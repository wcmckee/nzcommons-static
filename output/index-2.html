<p>Earlier this year, Upper Hutt City Library launched <a href="http://uhcl.recollect.co.nz/" target="_blank">RECOLLECT</a>, an online repository of materials from its community archive. The announcement made<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/upper-hutt-leader/7825164/Upper-Hutt-heritage-database-makes-history" target="_blank"> the front page of the Upper Hutt Leader</a>, where it was celebrated as “a New Zealand first.”</p>
<p>The RECOLLECT platform allows users to browse and discuss archival materials. At present, the site has over 15, 000 photos and hundreds of other items freely available to access and download.</p>
<p>What was not mentioned in the Leader story, however, was perhaps Recollect’s most remarkable feature: nearly all its heritage items—old and new—are made available under a Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence.</p>
<p>The Upper Hutt Community Archive was created in 1996, to host heritage materials from the local community. Fourteen year on, the Archive has grown into a rich resource for local residents, and includes thousands of photos, newspapers, oral histories and maps.</p>
<p>Until recently, most of these archival items were largely unknown. Members of the public would have to request copies of heritage materials, and would be charged an administrative fee by the UHCL. As UHCL Archivist Reid Perkins points out, this took up valuable staff time and tended to “put people off using the images.”</p>
<p>RECOLLECT allows user to download images from UHCL’s rich archive of local heritage items. As Reid points out, “this has been a popular feature. People like the fact that they have easy access to these images, which of course if we were using a traditional All Rights Reserved copyright model we wouldn’t be able to do.”</p>
<p>Reid came to the RECOLLECT project in May 2012, and says he was “very impressed” with the library’s attitude towards sharing and reuse. “A lot of institutions are quite risk averse. I was very pleased to come here and see that they didn’t seem to have that attitude.”</p>
<p>In partnership with <a href="http://www.micrographics.co.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Micrographic Services Ltd</a>., library staff agreed that the Creative Commons licences fit with the general ethos of the archive. Their remarkable range of openly licensed resources includes collections of The Upper Hutt Leader itself.</p>
<p>Reid admits that the question of rights has given him some nervous nights, but that most people seem to be willing to allow the public to access and share their local heritage. “There does seem to be a good, positive attitude here.”</p>
<p>The main feeling seems to be that people are proud of their local history and want it better known. They want people to access their images.”</p>
<p>Reid points to the collection of photos by <a href="http://www.upperhuttcity.com/page/1079/JacksonWilfredRevelle.boss" target="_blank">Revelle Jackson, a prominent Hutt Valley photographer</a>. Jackson was the official photographer for local events—including A&amp;P shows, birthday parties and weddings—for several decades, and his collection of over 8000 photos is now available for download for distribution and reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial licence.</p>
<p>When asked about other libraries following in the footsteps of UHCL, Reid points out that most libraries and archives are caught between two basic mandates: to protect the collections and to provide access. While Reid understands the dilemmas many librarians and archivists face, he says he’s “pleased to be working in a place where it does seem to lean the other way, towards openness.”</p>
<p>Reid says that he would “definitely encourage other institutions to go down this route.”</p>
<p>For smaller, regional organisations, open access and open licensing are a good way to encourage the local community to share and reuse heritage materials. “Our issue is getting people to use the stuff. Our issue is access, getting people using our collections. As soon as we are fairly sure that there aren’t any copyright claims, we want to put the work in circulation.”</p>
<p>As local groups continue to donate materials to the archive, Reid looks forward to growing Recollect. “A lot of material is coming in digital form only. We often digitise the material, and let the donors keep the original. We’re building up a lot of material like that.”</p>
<p>As the collections grow, so does the range of materials available for sharing and creative reuse. “I’ve been getting donors’ permission to use their material digitally, and this includes Creative Commons licensing. I make a point of telling people, because they might be worried or misunderstand, but no one seems that concerned. They want their images to be out there and available.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always made an effort to explain the licences to donors, and no one’s been bothered so far, to be honest. So far, everyone’s agreed.”</p>

<h5>By Fabiana Kubke</h5>
<p>I think I met Penny Carnaby, then National Librarian, back in 2010.</p>
<p>She did not have to convince me about the value of Open Access. What I did learn from her was that Open Access had implications that went beyond the value of sharing scientific findings as broadly as possible. Science after all is a human activity, and as such, part of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Until then I thought of research publications as being about sharing results – or rather making them publicly known. There is value in that, and the more broadly access to those findings is given, and the more flexible the licenses for reuse that are attached to them, the better. Open Access under open licenses allows that. But when challenged with the idea of the cultural heritage of science I started thinking about what science is – and about how there is much more to science than just that published article.</p>
<p>Research articles constitute a narrative that is built around the gathered data. The structure of that story is partly defined by the data, the models prescribed by scholarly publishers, and to some extent, the audience - primarily other researchers. This narrative, however, does not necessarily reflect the <em>process</em> of science –a process that produced the data in the first place.</p>
<p><a title="pottery by gnackgnackgnack, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnackgnackgnack/4367460746/"><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4065/4367460746_81ec439c78.jpg" alt="pottery" width="325" height="216"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnackgnackgnack/4367460746/">Pottery</a> by gnackgnackgnack, via Flickr.

<p>A lot of what happens in science that ultimately leads to the “paper” takes the form of conversations around small tables, reading and reflections on the bus, or seemingly random thoughts on a sleepless night. We struggle with things we don’t understand. We seek advice from our colleagues or information in the published literature. We talk a lot – at lab meetings, conferences, holding a pipette over the bench, or while trying to figure out what that strange structure under the microscope is. That is the science happening. The article is what happens after all of that is done and dusted, and rarely, if ever, does it share what got us to that point.</p>
<p>There is no room in the scholarly article to capture that process. Yet, I’d like to argue, understanding this process is crucial for understanding science. The paper helps us get the knowledge. But the science lives in that messy and wonderful process. You can’t become a scientist by reading journal articles – you learn to be a scientist by <em>being </em>a scientist and participating in that array of human activities that form part of the cultural experience of science.</p>
<p>I am grateful to Penny for making me look at science as a human activity – not unlike writing a book, moulding a pot out of clay, or painting a landscape. And like these other activities, preserving the end product is easier than capturing the process. But unlike these other creators, we scientists are in the unique position of not directly profiting from the sales of our creative output. As Peter Suber eloquently puts it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“It’s enough to know that their employers pay them salaries, freeing them to give away their work, that they write for impact rather than money, and that they score career points when they make the kind of impact they hoped to make.”[1]</p>

<p>There is nothing in today’s technology that prevents us from freely sharing our findings. So why not start sharing more openly and broadly both the process and the final manuscripts? Why not make sure those articles can be preserved, used, re-used, mixed and mashed by institutions and individuals?</p>
<p>I say it is time to say goodbye to ‘publish or perish’ and time to say hello to ‘share or perish’.</p>

<h5>By Cameron Neylon</h5>
<p>[This post was originally published on Cameron Neylon's blog, <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-challenge-for-scholarly-societies/" target="_blank">Science in the Open</a>, under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication</a>.]</p>
<p>With major governments signalling a shift to Open Access it seems like a good time to be asking which organisations in the scholarly communications space will survive the transition. It is likely that the major current publishers will survive, although relative market share and focus is likely to change. But the biggest challenges are faced by small to medium scholarly societies that depend on journal income for their current viability. What changes are necessary for them to navigate this transition and can they survive?</p>
<p>The fate of scholarly societies is one of the most contentious and even emotional in the open access landscape. Many researchers have strong emotional ties to their disciplinary societies and these societies often play a crucial role in supporting meetings, providing travel stipends to young researchers, awarding prizes, and representing the community. At the same time they face a peculiar bind. The money that supports these efforts often comes from journal subscriptions. Researchers are very attached to the benefits but seem disinclined to countenance membership fees that would support them. This problem is seen across many parts of the research enterprise – where researchers, or at least their institutions, are paying for services through subscriptions but unwilling to pay for them directly.</p>
<p>What options do societies have? Those with a large publication program could do worse in the short term than look very closely at the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2012/gold-for-gold-rsc-open-access.asp">announcement</a> from the UK <a title="Royal Society of Chemistry" href="http://www.rsc.org/" target="_blank">Royal Society of Chemistry</a> in July 2012. The RSC is offering an institutional mechanism whereby those institutions that have a particular level of subscription will receive an equivalent amount of publication services, set at the price of £1600 per paper. This is very clever for the RSC: it allows it to help institutions prepare effectively for changes in UK policy, it costs them nothing, and lets them experiment with a route to transition to full open access at relatively low risk. Because the contribution of UK institutions with this particular subscription plan is relatively small it is unlikely to reduce subscriptions significantly in the short term, but if and when it does it positions the RSC to offer package deals on publication services with very similar terms. Tactically by moving early it also allows the RSC to hold a higher price point than later movers will – and will help to increase its market share in the UK over that of the ACS.</p>
<p>Another route is for societies to explore the “indy band model”. Similar to bands that are trying to break through by giving away their recorded material but charging for live gigs, societies could focus on raising money through meetings rather than publications. Some societies already do this – having historically focussed on running large scale international or national meetings. The “in person” experience is something that cannot yet be done cheaply over the internet and “must attend” meetings offer significant income and sponsorship opportunities. There are challenges to be navigated here – ensuring commercial contributions don’t damage the brand or reduce the quality of meetings being a big one – but expect conference fees to rise as subscription incomes drop. Societies that currently run lavish meetings off the back of journal income will face a particular struggle over the next two to five years.</p>
<p>But even meetings are unlikely to offer a long term solution. It’s some way off yet but rising costs of travel and increasing quality of videoconferencing will start to eat into this market as well. If all the big speakers are dialling it in, is it still worth attending the meeting? So what are the real value offerings that societies can provide? What are the things that are unique to that community collection of expertise that no-one else can provide?</p>
<p>Peer review (pre-, post-, or peri-publication) is one of them. Publication services are not. Publication, in the narrow sense of “making public”, will be commoditised, if it hasn’t already. With new players like <a href="http://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a> and <a href="http://f1000research.com/">F1000 Research</a> alongside the now fairly familiar landscape of the wide-ranging <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PBinfield/ssp-presentation4">megajournal</a> the space for publication services to make fat profits is narrowing rapidly. This will, sooner or later, be a low margin business with a range of options to choose from when someone, whether a society or a single researcher, is looking for a platform to publish their work. While the rest of us may argue whether this will happen next year or in a decade, for societies it is the long term that matters, and in the long term commoditisation will happen.</p>
<p>The unique offering that a society brings is the <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/the-economics-of-scientific-collaboration/">aggregation and organisation of expert attention</a>. In a given space a scholarly society has a unique capacity to coordinate and organise assessment by domain experts. I can certainly imagine a society offering peer review as a core member service, independent of whether the thing being reviewed is already “published”. This might be a particular case where there are real benefits to operating a small scale – both because of the peer pressure for each member of the community to pull their weight and because the scale of the community lends itself to being understood and managed as a small set of partly connected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">small world networks</a>. The question is really whether the sums add up. Will members pay $100 or $500 per year for peer review services? Would that provide enough income? What about younger members without grants? And perhaps crucially, how cheap would a separated publication platform have to be to make the sums look good?</p>
<p>Societies are all about community. Arguably most completely missed the boat on the potential of the social web when they could have built community hubs of real value – and those that didn’t miss it entirely largely created badly built and ill thought through community forums well after the first flush of failed generic “Facebook for Science” clones had faded. But another chance is coming. As the ratchet moves on funder and government open access policies, society journals stuck in a subscription model will become increasingly unattractive options for publication. The slow rate of progress and disciplinary differences will allow some to hold on past the point of no return and these societies will wither and die. Some societies will investigate transitional pricing models. I commend the example of the RSC to small societies as something to look at closely. Some may choose to move to publishing collections in larger journals where they retain editorial control. My bet is that those that survive will be the ones that find a way to make the combined expertise of the community pay – and I think the place to look for that will be those societies that find ways to decouple the value they offer through peer review from the costs of publication services.</p>

<h5>By Kathleen Fitzpatrick</h5>
<p>[This is an edited version of Kathleen's keynote address to the Modern Language Association conference in 2012. You can find the full speech at her website, <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/giving-it-away/" target="_blank">Planned Obsolescence</a>.]</p>
<p>As you might guess from my title, this presentation focuses in large part on questions of open access as they might affect our thinking about the future of scholarly communication. “Open access,” I’m sure I don’t need to tell you, is a fraught concept among both scholars and publishers, one beset by a lot of misunderstandings, both intentional and unintentional.</p>
<p>Arguments circulate out there saying, for instance, that open access will open the floodgates to a lot of bad scholarship, when in fact open access publishing is perfectly compatible with peer review, and there are many OA journals that are more selective than their closed-access counterparts. There are folks who argue that open access is financially unsustainable, or even, as has been suggested by the recent proposal of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act">Research Works Act</a> in Congress, an unreasonable infringement on publisher income, when in fact a range of new models for open access publishing are coming into being, and several of the major commercial journal publishers have recently announced new OA ventures, which they of course would never do if they hadn’t found a business model in it somewhere. On the other hand, there are equally misguided convictions out there that open access publishing is free; clearly that’s not so. What I am hoping to do in this talk, however, is to shift our thinking about open access, for the moment, from a focus on <em>costs</em> to a focus on <em>values</em>, though without entirely leaving behind the overwhelming and at times quite grim economic realities by which we’re surrounded.</p>
<p>To begin, a bit of background: discussions of the possibilities for new open publishing models began online in the early 1990s, as a number of scientists and librarians recognized that the growth of the Internet made possible the free and open reproduction of scholarly literature. Stevan Harnad pushed these discussions into the open by submitting what he called a “subversive proposal” to an email list in June 1994, <a href="http://www.arl.org/sc/subversive/introduction-2.shtml" target="_blank">which was later described as pointing out</a> that “the scientific journal and the scholarly monograph are threatened by rising costs, rising output, and constrained academic budgets. The most painful paradox is that in the interests of science, the law of the market cannot be allowed to function. An item with a very small market may yet be the indispensable link in a chain of research that leads to a result of high social value.” One means of escaping this paradox, Harnad suggested, was the creation of globally accessible electronic self-deposit archives of scholarly articles – the foundation of today’s institutional and disciplinary repositories.</p>
<p>Over the years that followed Harnad’s provocation, the guiding principles of the open access movement began to be articulated, leading to the <a href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> published in 2002, which gave the movement its name. Following behind the Budapest initiative were the June 2003 <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/%7Epeters/fos/bethesda.htm">Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing</a> and the October 2003 <a href="http://oa.mpg.de/berlin-prozess/berliner-erklarung/">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Scientific Knowledge</a>. Together, Budapest-Bethesda-Berlin defined the agenda for open access scholarly publishing.</p>
<p>The tenth anniversary of the Budapest Open Access Initiative is rapidly approaching; in the intervening decade, the open access movement spread through a dramatic increase in the number of OA journals (the “gold” model of open access), including the very public mass resignations of a number of editorial boards of closed-access journals, who then joined together to start new publications online. Additionally, the open access movement over the last decade was profoundly expanded through a growing number of institutional and disciplinary repositories (the “green” model of open access), as well as an increasing number of institution- and funder-based mandates requiring the deposit of the products of research done under their auspices. (It is of course those mandates that the Research Works Act seeks to attack.) By this past November, at Berlin 9, the ninth annual conference associated with the Berlin Declaration and the first to be held in the U.S., 34 North American signatories had endorsed the declaration and agreed to uphold its principles, including more than 20 colleges and universities. These signatories collectively produce a powerful demonstration of the expansion of U.S. commitment to facilitating open access, a commitment that can be seen at the national level in the recent White House Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications.</p>
<p>Though these conversations, like the White House RFI, have to this point been overwhelmingly dominated by the sciences, the Berlin 9 conference took on as part of its focus this year the impact of open access on the humanities. While our fields bear certain interests in common with the sciences, there are a few important differences as well. The most obvious of these is a radical difference in funding systems and levels. Scientific research is all but impossible to conduct without large-scale grant funding, and scientists have long been able to write publishing costs into their grants. As a result, the business model for open access scientific publishing was relatively clear: shift from a reader-pays to an author-pays model. Easy-peasy. In the humanities, however, not only is the available funding generally too low to accommodate significant publishing charges to authors, but the vast majority of research is either supported by the scholar’s institution or is self-funded.</p>
<p>It’s for that reason that I’m not standing here suggesting that a large-scale transition of humanities publishing to an open access model would be easy; it wouldn’t. Humanities publishing faces a set of financial constraints that are daunting at the best of times, and crushing in times of economic retraction. As I argue in <em>Planned Obsolescence</em>, it is of course perfectly well possible to make scholarly publishing profitable; the Wileys and the Elseviers have certainly managed it, but they’ve done so at the direct expense of our universities. For not-for-profit scholarly publishers to follow the commercial publishers’ lead would for a range of reasons I explore in the book be a disaster. Those presses can’t be beaten at their own game, as the large conglomerates that operate them will always be able to conduct business more efficiently, and more ruthlessly, than the university should want to do. But nor can we simply hand over the business of scholarly publishing to them to operate; as John Thompson noted in <em>Books in the Digital Age</em>, in times of economic slowdown “commercial logic would tend to override any obligation [such companies] might feel to the scholarly community” (98), leaving nothing to stop them from eliminating academic publishing entirely, if it ceases to pay.</p>
<p>So we can’t beat them, and we can’t join them; what we can do is change the game entirely. And it’s for this reason that I want to argue that, despite the serious difficulties involved, a transition to open access publishing might be desirable – desirable enough that rather than ending our conversations with the seeming insurmountableness of the financial obstacles, we should instead start figuring out what it will to take to get around them.</p>
<p>One thing that makes open access publishing so desirable for the future of scholarly communication is the increased impact that openly distributed scholarship is able to have, and study after study shows that open-access literature – whether that published in “gold” OA journals or that deposited in “green” OA archives – is more cited than is work published in traditional closed venues. In addition to facilitating traditional researcher access, however, openly published work can also reach a much broader range of readers – students and instructors at undergraduate teaching institutions and at secondary schools, for instance, as well as folks who work outside academia entirely. Open-access scholarship has the potential to reach a broad spectrum of potentially interested publics.</p>
<p>We in the humanities often resist opening our work to these publics, fearing the consequences of such openness – and not without reason. The world at times fails to understand what we do, and, because our subject matter seems as though it ought to be comprehensible (you’re just writing about books, or movies, or art, after all!), isn’t inclined to wrestle with the difficulties that our work presents; their dismissive responses give us the clear sense that the public doesn’t take our work as seriously as, say, papers in high-energy physics, which few lay readers would assume their ability to comprehend without some background or training. As a result of these doubled misunderstandings, we close our work off from the public, arguing that we’re only writing for a small group of specialists anyhow. In which case, why would open access matter?</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that the more we close our work away from the public, and the more we refuse to engage in dialogue across the boundaries of the academy, the more we undermine that public’s willingness to fund our research and our institutions. As Kathy Woodward put it so brilliantly on Friday, the major crisis facing the funding of higher education is an increasingly widespread conviction that education is a private responsibility rather than a public good; we wind up strengthening that conviction when we treat our work as private, by keeping it to ourselves. Closing our work away from non-scholarly readers, and keeping our conversations private, might protect us from public criticism, but it can’t protect us from public apathy, a condition that is, in the current economy, far more dangerous. This is not to say that such openness doesn’t bear risks, particularly for scholars working in controversial areas of research, but it is to say that only through open dialogue across the walls of the ivory tower will we have any chance of convincing the broader public, including our governmental funding bodies, of the importance of our work. And let me say this clearly:  increasing the discoverability of scholarly work on the web, making it available to a broader readership, is a Good Thing, not just for the individual scholar but for the field in which she works.  The more that well-researched, thoughtful scholarship on contemporary cultural issues is available to, for instance, journalists covering those issues for popular venues, the richer the discourse in those publications will become – increasing, not incidentally, the visibility of institutions of higher education, and their importance to the culture at large.</p>
<p>Publishing is never free, of course; it either costs us in dollars or in labor (and often both), and sustainability in scholarly publishing has often been equated with the need to produce revenue based on the sale of publishing’s products. As I’ve argued at length, however, the current system of scholarly publishing is already not sustainable for most not-for-profit organizations, and some of the ostensible solutions – such as handing journals over to the commercial publishers who seem to have found a viable profit model – are only making things worse. One might see here the cautionary tale of a fellow humanities scholarly organization that, facing a budgetary crisis, contracted with a commercial publisher to distribute its journals. That organization received a nice bit of income in the short term – but the commercial publisher involved immediately more than doubled the institutional subscription fees for the journals involved, ensuring that more libraries would be forced not to carry those journals, and thus reducing the potential impact of the work published in them. And needless to say, however much the organization involved earned in this exchange, the corporate publisher earned more.</p>
<p>So rather than giving our work away to corporate entities that will profit at our expense, might we instead find a way to make a virtue of our market failures? What if we understood sustainability not as the ability to produce revenue, but the ability to keep the engine of generosity running? What if we were to allow the engine of generosity on which so much of the enterprise runs to affect the final point of distribution, if we were to embrace the gift economy of scholarly communication and make a gift of our work to others? What might happen if outreach, generosity, giving it away were our primary values?</p>
<p>Donald Hall has argued that the future viability of higher education requires that we collectively reclaim the intellectual growth fostered in the academy as a public good rather than a private responsibility. If we ask this of our institutions, and our funders, we must also ask it of ourselves.</p>
<p>There are financial realities that must be acknowledged in all of this, and I don’t want to minimize the difficulties of grappling with them. But in all such discussion about such financial realities, I cannot help but remember something Michael Jensen of the National Academies Press once told me. The NAP makes all of its publications freely and openly available on the web, producing revenue by selling print versions of that content. Admittedly, NAP has probably lost revenue that it could have obtained if it had refrained from giving the work it publishes away online – but it has gained significantly in visibility, in discoverability, and in goodwill. As Jensen said, when I asked him about this model, the press’s mandate is to make as much of its work available as freely and openly as it can while still breaking even. And this is the ethos that I would love to see become the guiding principle for scholarly communication more generally.</p>
<p>How much can we make freely and openly available in this fashion? How might we reimagine the production of revenue in scholarly communication from a basis in the sale of content to a basis in the provision of services? How can we work together to reorient our perspective from <em>costs</em> to <em>values</em>? How might openness allow us to better engage not just with one another but with the world around us, treating that world not just as an object laid open to our masterful scrutiny, but instead as a complex conglomeration of agents both able and entitled to enter into conversation with us? What if we were to recognize that the only way to hold onto the knowledge we have – and to help higher education and the communities within which we work to thrive – is to give it away?</p>

<h5>David Nichols</h5>
<p>Universities have long been accused of operating in an ivory tower, separate from the rest of society. One area where this characterisation is fairly accurate is in the accessibility of university research works. The current system of scholarly communication places most articles from most authors behind a ‘paywall’ at a publisher’s website. How well does this arrangement support the role of universities in society?</p>
<p>A common description of the role of a university is that it should act as a critic and conscience of society. In New Zealand, this role is explicitly laid out in legislation, in <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM183668.htm" target="_blank">Section 162 (4) (a) (v) of the Education Act 1989</a> (l).</p>
<p>Jones, Galvin and Woodhouse (2000) addressed this role and commented:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Research and publication go hand in hand, so much so that both are crucially dependent upon the existence of academic freedom. Put another way, academic freedom to conduct research but not publish the results of that research is a sham.”</p>

<p>They did not address where the research is published or how easy it might be for members of society to access research findings. Although there are no calculations of exactly where New Zealand research is published, it is likely that most research authored by researchers at New Zealand universities is behind publishers’ paywalls.</p>
<p>Two of the main arguments for allowing society at large access to the results of university research are:</p>
<ul>
<li>that research has typically been supported, in some way,  through public funding;</li>

    <li>that legislation and policy that impacts on society is often based on research findings.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/nz-university-system" target="_blank">Universities New Zealand</a> break down the income to universities as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The New Zealand universities receive approximately 40% of their annual income from government grants - $1.3 billion of the combined total income of $3.1 billion recorded in 2010.  The remaining income is split evenly between student fees and other sources – principally research contracts and trading income.”</p>

<p>Student fees are significantly facilitated through the student loans system and research contracts are often derived from public funds; public assistance, then, in some form, is inherent in most university research. Do members of the public have a right to access these research results? Do they have a right to freely access these results? Where research is used to inform government policy then there is a straightforward case that those who will be affected by new laws should have easy access to the underlying evidence.</p>
<p>Funding agencies around the world are increasingly recognising that they should aim for the widest distribution of the articles describing research they have funded (or rather, that taxpayers have funded). This position has been <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUK%20_Policy_on_Access_to_Research_Outputs.pdf" target="_blank">summarised recently by Research Councils UK</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“As major bodies charged with investing public money in research, the Research Councils take responsibility in making the outputs from this research publicly available – not just to other researchers, but also to potential users in business, charitable and public sectors, and to the general public.”</p>

<p>Statements such as these represent  a shift in attitudes toward scholarly communication. The evolution of academic publishing allowed researchers to direct their major outputs to journals that were largely unknown and mostly inaccessible to the general public. Communication of research results to wider society, or outreach, has been regarded as an extra and distinct activity that not all academics engaged in. In addition, the value system within academia has focussed on publishing in these (to many, obscure) journals.</p>
<p>All these behaviours have reinforced a separation between university research and society; the stereotypical ivory tower characterisation of academics has been largely consistent with their publishing practices. Although these articles can be accessed via public libraries they require extra effort on the part of information searchers. The reality of our connected society is that information access is often practically a matter of whether a document is instantly available on the internet.</p>
<p>A counter-argument that questions the value of public open access to university research is whether the general public can usefully engage with primary research documents. Although there are clearly examples where this is true the growing education levels of society in general suggest the force of this argument will fade over time. From the perspective of an individual university then one segment of society who would clearly be able to benefit from access are their own alumni. The value of public access to research across society as a whole is shown in the variety of scenarios gathered at <a href="http://whoneedsaccess.org/">whoneedsaccess.org</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, it is unreasonable for universities to claim to act as a critic and conscience of society when the results of those explorations are largely placed behind financial and logistical barriers. Whilst there are a variety of ways for academics to engage with society, the single simplest approach is to allow society to easily access their work.</p>

<h5>By Dr Siouxsie Wiles</h5>
<p>A few days ago I was asked what my role is in science. It’s a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately*. So, who am I and what is my role? I am a publicly funded <a href="http://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/sms/staffct/staff_details.aspx?staffID=7377696C333834">scientist</a> with a passion for nasty microbes and things that glow in the dark. I am also a <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/infectious-thoughts/">blogger</a> and <a href="http://thecusp.org.nz/">podcaster</a> and have struck up a relationship with a <a href="http://lukeharrisgraphics.com/">great team of graphic artists</a> to make a series of <a href="http://youtu.be/UUUytRoI-5g">short YouTube animations</a> about glowing creatures and science. Until recently I would have said my role in science was to do research, but with a side-line in communicating science in an effort to generate public interest and excitement.</p>
<p>The fact that communication is seen almost as an optional extra in a career in science is quite astonishing, I think. Why else in this digital age of multidisciplinary science would we write papers incomprehensible to almost all but those scientists in our own narrow field? Why else would we publish in journals only accessible to those institutions with budgets big enough to afford the subscription charges? In case you were thinking that it is only small, non-research or polytechnic institutions that are affected by this, last year for example, the University of California (UC) <a href="//libraries.ucsd.edu/collections/Nature_Faculty_Letter-June_2010.pdf)" target="_blank">threatened to cancel their subscription</a> to all <a href="http://www.nature.com/" target="_blank">Nature Publishing Group</a> (NPG) journals after NPG wanted to increase the price of UC’s licence by 400%. This is also a problem in New Zealand universities.  Both as a scientist and a blogger, I’ve often wanted to read a paper that wasn’t available through my institutional subscription. With time at a premium, I find that I don’t bother going through the hoops of trying to get hold of the paper by other means. Are my peers doing the same with my papers? If they are, presumably, this will affect how widely my research is cited.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I started my <a href="http://siouxsiewiles.blogspot.co.nz/" target="_blank">own research group</a> a few years ago, and had to take responsibility for deciding which journal to submit papers to, that I realised just how ridiculous the traditional model of science publishing is. In essence the tax payer funds my research, pays for me to publish it (in the form of colour page charges as a lot of my data is presented using colour figures) and then every institution, be it university or Crown Research Institute, in New Zealand has to pay subscription charges so that other scientists here can read what I’ve discovered. This strikes me as a terrible waste of resources – resources which could be used to fund more research, rather than provide obscene profits for giant publishing houses. This is why I support the Open Access model offered by the likes of the <a href="http://www.plos.org/" target="_blank">Public Library of Science (PLOS)</a> and <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank">BioMed Central (BMC)</a>. These platforms charge a fee to publish but then the material is freely available to all under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</a> where the authors retain copyright for their article.</p>
<p>But the Open Access ‘movement’ has the potential to do more than just improve my citations and allow more money to be spent on doing science. Opening up the fruits of scientific research to anyone with access to the internet changes everything.  It gives people access to the science they fund. The importance of this was brought home to me recently when I attended a talk by University of Otago archaeologist, <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/anthropology/arch/people/walter.html" target="_blank">Prof. Richard Walter</a>. Prof. Walter was discussing the dubious evidence for alternative theories of how humans came to colonise New Zealand. What frustrated him most, he said, was the ease with which such ‘evidence’ perpetuated on the internet, while the real science behind New Zealand’s colonisation is only available in scientific journals behind a pay wall. The same can be said for alternative views on the safety of vaccination and other health issues.</p>
<p>But herein lies the challenge. For Open Access to really be useful for the public at large, we scientists need to change the way we write about our work. At the very least, every paper published under an Open Access banner should have a summary of the main findings that can be understood by a general audience. Even better would be for whole articles to be written in this way, so that scientists from diverse fields can read each other’s work without needing Wikipedia and a dictionary.</p>
<p>So how do I see my role in science now? Well, the doing science bit hasn’t changed. But I now see that a desire to get the public excited about science isn’t enough. I live in a country bucking international trends with increasing rates of infectious diseases (1**), where sexually transmitted diseases are a growing cause of infertility, and where misinformation on vaccination and health endanger lives. Science can empower people to make informed choices that shape their future for the better. This is the message I want to communicate and why I believe unrestricted access to the science we fund is in everyone’s best interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Partly as a result of numerous chats with the wonderful Jacquie Bay, director of the <a href="http://www.lenscience.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/" target="_blank">Liggins Education Network for Science</a> at the University of Auckland, a fantastic initiative that promotes connections between schools and scientists. Partly because I was lucky enough to attend the late Sir Paul Callaghan’s <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/events/2012-transit-of-venus-forum-lifting-our-horizon/" target="_blank">Transit of Venus Forum</a> in Gisborne earlier this year.</li>

<p><strong>The OER university: Kiwi ingenuity leads a low cost, low risk but high impact solution for open education futures worldwide</strong></p>
<p>The OER university (OERu) will provide free learning opportunities for all students worldwide using courses based solely on open educational resources (OER) and open access (OA) materials with pathways for learners to earn credible degrees. The OER Foundation, headquarted in New Zealand, is leading an international innovation partnership of accredited universities, polytechnics and community colleges committed to providing more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal higher education sector.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Open Educational Resources</strong> (OER) are materials used to support education that may be freely accessed, reused, modified and shared by anyone (<a title="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2011/07/open-educational-resources-definition.htmlOpen" href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2011/07/open-educational-resources-definition.htmlOpen" rel="nofollow">Downes 2011</a>). <strong>Creative Commons</strong> licenses are enabling an international network of accredited universities and polytechnics to widen access to more affordable degrees. The <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/FAQs" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/FAQs" rel="nofollow">OER Tertiary Education Network</a>, the driving force behind the <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" rel="nofollow">OER university</a> (OERu) collaboration have adopted the <a title="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition" href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition" rel="nofollow">Free Cultural Works approved licenses</a> (<a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="nofollow">CC BY</a> and <a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" rel="nofollow">CC BY-SA</a>) as the default for OERu courses.</p>

<p dir="LTR">With OER, the marginal cost of replicating digital learning materials is near zero and sharing development costs improves cost efficiencies. Consequently, an international <strong>network</strong> of <strong>accredited institutions</strong> would be able to leverage <strong>significant savings</strong> in the cost and time required for the assembly and maintenance of OER courses combined with significant efficiency gains when <strong>operating at scale. </strong>Moreover<strong>, </strong>OER provides a viable solution for education institutions to respond to their educational mission of social inclusion.</p>

<p>The scale is guaranteed because of the unsatisfied global demand for higher education. Researchers at UNESCO and the Commonwealth of Learning conservatively predict that over the next fifteen years, the post-secondary education system will need to provide for an additional 100 million places. The conventional model of higher education provision is simply not able to respond to this level of demand for education.</p>
<p>The confluence of these economic and digital technology enablers provide fertile ground for designing a <strong>sustainable open education ecosystem</strong> whereby institutions can provide free access to learning opportunities. Building on Professor Emeritus Jim Taylor's 2007 ideas to <a title="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" rel="nofollow">provide assessment on demand</a>, the OERu concept was conceived.</p>
<p>Individuals are free to learn from digital materials hosted on the open web. The problem is that learners who access digital OERs on the web and acquire knowledge and skills either formally or informally, alone or in groups, cannot readily have their learning assessed and subsequently receive appropriate academic recognition for their efforts.</p>
<p>OERu learners will gain <strong>free access to high quality courses</strong> that are designed for independent-study using <strong>OER</strong>. OERu learners will receive student support through a global network of volunteers and peer support using social software technologies. Students can be <strong>assessed for a fee</strong> by participating institutions and earn a <strong>credible credential. </strong>Using OERit is possible to build a parallel learning universe to provide more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal education sector.</p>
<p>With a healthy dose of our Kiwi “can do” attitude which favours pragmatism above pretence, in November 2011, the OER Foundation convened an open meeting of <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a> to plan the practical implementation of the OERu. With funding support from UNESCO, this <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">landmark meeting </a>was streamed live on the Internet modelling open participation and collaboration on a global scale. Five tertiary education institutions in New Zealand have embraced their responsibility to ensure more sustainable education futures, by joining the OERu network as <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a>. Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, NorthTec the Open Polytechnic, Otago Polytechnic and the University of Canterbury are the New Zealand institutions who are leading open education futures in New Zealand. The <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" rel="nofollow">OERu</a> network, now numbering 20 contributing institutions will be able to accredit OER learning on five continents mapped to the credentialing frameworks of 20 different countries.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The vision of the OERu collaboration has now turned into reality with the <a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">recent </a><a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> of the the launch of the first OERu course,  <a title="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" href="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" rel="nofollow">Regional Relations in Asia and the Pacific</a> (AST1000) developed by the University of Southern Queensland. Professor Jan Thomas, Vice Chancellor and President of the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) <a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">noted that</a>: “USQ is proud to give students worldwide, the ability to access university level courses and where <strong>cost has been removed as a barrier to learning</strong>”.</p>

<p>University leaders and administrators are concerned with how to ensure sustainability of OER initiatives on campus. Indeed, if OER projects are managed as an add-on to existing operations, the sources of funding to sustain OER projects can be a challenge. However, the strategic solution is to embed OER development as an integral component of business as usual.</p>
<p>From an investment-decision perspective, participation in the OERu <strong>does not require new money</strong>, but rather a reallocation of existing staff time to releasing selected development outputs under open content licenses for the OERu network as part of mainstream operations. The OERu model anticipates that no more than 1% of existing budget time would be required for release under open content licenses. The institutional costs of assessment and credentialisation services are recouped on a <strong>cost-recovery basis</strong> from student fees and/or other sources.</p>
<p>Consider for example that the average tuition fees for a 4-year bachelor degree at a public university in the United States is US$26,312, excluding accommodation and textbook costs. At Otago Polytechnic, the full tuition cost of a 4-year degree equivalent is approximately US$19,452. The summative assessment and credentialing services for the first OERu prototype course would equate to a 4-year bachelor degree costing US$6,759. As the OERu network grows and begins to leverage economies of scale, it is feasible that further cost reductions can be implemented.</p>
<p>The OERu network has succeeded in shifting the strategic focus of open education from how to achieve sustainable OER projects to how institutions will remain sustainable without the mainstream adoption of OER.</p>
<p>The OERu model is inspired by the concept of “<em>smart philanthropy</em>”. While the OERu is primarily designed to widen access to learning in higher education through the social inclusion and community service agenda, our approach encourages member institutions to reintegrate the lessons learned into mainstream operations. Tacit knowledge and capability gained through the OERu's open design and development model can be reinvested back into the core business operations to improve effectiveness of the higher education sector and generate new business opportunities now possible with the OERu model. The OERu network is an exemplar for low cost, low risk, but high impact innovation.</p>

<p>3.5 inch floppy.  That’s the medium I stored my thesis on when I finally completed it in 1996.  I don’t have any of these disks left – or a machine that will read them for that matter – so the only copies I have of my thesis are the physical ones I got back with examiners’ scribbles on and one of the three hard copies I had to get bound.  Another of these will be sitting in the library here at the University of Otago on the reference shelves behind the front desks, unless it’s been moved into the archives for the benefit of posterity.</p>
<p>At the time it didn’t even occur to me that I could publish it in any other way that would allow anyone outside of Otago to find it, let alone read it.  After all these were the days of dial up, where high-tech web sites like the Yahoo! home page were made up of a series of text links.</p>
<p><img id="internal-source-marker_0.9908701623638819" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3ieuuAwPooQseuAkO5NjmZ6A8XqrQ1ivUKXWe7a4WwyAeO-95FWCexX62UMbsm5QoIV8-_lNkA1iKUfIjaW7KpGM__5VJV6WeN54aYGIJlxY5GyMDxk" alt="" width="287" height="290"> Source: Wayback Machine, yahoo.com, 23 December 1996</p>
<p>I make these nostalgic meanderings to demonstrate how far we’ve come in such a short time.  Probably the first time it occurred to me that my magnum opus could be made available to all and sundry was when I discovered (by accident, when googling myself one day) that <a href="http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=YXCVMgAACAAJ&amp;dq=satire+and+dickens+richard+white&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-LsHkBtNBf&amp;sig=c1JbmmLFytBRDd1g59tlYpLqx9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PV1-UMX2CYLPrQf8joHIBg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ">Google Books had indexed it</a>.  Now, of course, students and staff can publish in their library’s institutional repositories, each with its own catchy title (ours being – excuse the bias – one of the better acronyms out there: the <a href="http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/">Otago University Research Archive</a> or OUR Archive).  And these repositories are assuming increasing importance as the academic community discusses how open access publishing might work.  Anyone reading my ramblings here is likely to be familiar with the UK’s <a href="https://webmail.staff.otago.ac.nz/owa/redir.aspx?C=3oPMcSj4xEunMFQs8BokU2EhWGvNf88IWW2l1JymctLqFTVl2elS_B13mSqq0ZF83od__n1Jd30.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.researchinfonet.org%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f06%2fFinch-Group-report-executive-summary-FINAL-VERSION.pdf">Finch report</a> and subsequent declarations from UK and European research Councils that publicly-funded research will  soon be required to be published in some open form.  Australia’s two major funding agencies, the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) have made similar noises, with the latter careful to include the ‘Green,’ self-archiving model made possible by institutional repositories as one of the possible models.  (Librarians inform me, by the way, that Australia’s institutional repository infrastructure is built on the same technology New Zealand’s).</p>
<p>Internationally things are happening at a lightening pace (for academia anyway).  To me one of the most interesting recent initiatives has been the <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/media/HowOpenIsIt.shtml">Open Access Spectrum discussion paper</a> released by PLOS, SPARC and OASPA.  The general tenet of the document was to move the conversation from “is it open access” to “how open is it?”</p>
<p>We wait to see what the NZ government or our major funding agencies say.  The NZ Government has made its own <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/declaration-open-and-transparent-government">Declaration on Open &amp; Transparent Government</a> and developed the Creative Commons-powered <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/nzgoal/read-nzgoal">Open Access &amp; Licensing Framework</a> as a guide to open access and licensing for state sector agencies to realise the potential benefits of widening access to the “vast quantities” of information and data they hold.  Interestingly, the Framework specifically excluded tertiary education institutions from its remit (see section 7(c)), presumably largely because it is far more difficult to say who actually owns the intellectual property in this sector.  But as yet there is no sign of a mandate that publicly-funded research must be made publicly available, though commentators suggest <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/openotago/2012/07/27/scientists-say-open-access-research-inevitable-in-nz-from-radio-nz/">this is inevitable</a>.</p>
<p>So, in the context of all these developments, where are we at really in the NZ tertiary sector?  If this is inevitable, how ready are we for this fundamental shift in mindset?  Let me add some local colour by providing my own perceptions in my role as Copyright Officer at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>Since all of these developments are underpinned by Creative Commons licensing, I think it’s worth asking what does the average academic know about CC?  Well, in 2012 the University had to undertake a survey of certain types of copyright material, which I was in charge of, so I took this opportunity to ask this very question.  In a section of the survey that asked about their practices in relation to copyright, I asked staff to rate from 1 to 5 how true a number of statements were for them, 1 being not true at all and 5 being completely true.  Based on over 800 responses, this was the result for my question about CC:</p>

<p>Almost half of our teaching staff rated their knowledge of Creative Commons at the lowest level on the scale.  When I broke this down according to the seniority of the staff (imagining that an elbow-patch-cardiganed professor would know a lot less than an iPad-Tweeting teaching fellow), the proportions hardly altered.  But I shouldn’t have been surprised.  This result reflects the inquiries I deal with on a day-to-day basis.  I am often the first person to tell many about this thing called CC; with others it’s something they’ve seen or heard of but are not really sure what it is all about.</p>
<p>Then what about our own institutional repository?  With help from our Digital Services Co-ordinator (and fellow CC advocate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Initiatives_lib">Allison Brown</a>, we’ve tracked repository deposits over the last 12 months to see what sort of access rights people are assigning to their work.  On average each month more than 50% of our staff and students making deposits are choosing ‘open access’ (which in this context means anyone can access it online but that it may still be all rights reserved).  The remainder chose ‘abstract only’ or ‘abstract only / inter-library loan.’    There are hints that the percentage of those choosing open access is increasing.</p>
<p>My experience is that there is still little understanding of the distinction between open <em>access</em> and <em>open</em> access.  And, yes, I did mean to write it that way to illustrate the point that the term means different things to different people. It’s the same with the MOOCs that are taking the higher education learning world by storm, where the courses are open for anyone to <em>access </em>but the resources themselves are not <em>open</em> access that I could re-use if I wanted to.</p>
<p>The very helpful <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/advanced_searches/new?locale=en">advanced search</a> on <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/">nzresearch.org.nz</a>, which indexes repositories across 10 NZ institutions, allows you to check which of these are recorded as having a licence that allows sharing, modification and commercial use.  Filtering by the University of Otago brings up 2,168 works in total: 2,146 of these are recorded as all rights reserved.  In other words, though all of these are open in terms of access, they are not in terms of re-use.  Do the advanced search for yourself, select the organisation of your choice, and you’ll find that you do not fare any better.  Of the over 30,000 works indexed only about 250 are recorded as having one of the more permissive licences.  And if you thought that choosing, say, only 2012 works would work out better, think again: that gives you 30 out of 1298.</p>
<p>These figures demonstrate the point that open access champions make about fostering a knowledge eco-system that enables re-use and re-imagining of knowledge, especially where its original purpose was to further human understanding.  As someone who people often come to when the time comes to deposit their thesis or research in OUR Archive, I can tell you that on a practical level all rights reserved copyright acts as a very real impediment to people choosing more open licences or even to allowing any sort of access to their work at all.  Often they need to remove parts that they have not been able to secure permission for and thereby reduce the effectiveness of their work.  I spoke to a PhD candidate just yesterday who had sought permission, heard nothing, and elected to remove graphs from his work for the OUR Archive version rather than keep trying.  This is particularly true of student researchers who lack the professional confidence of academic staff.  And if they do receive a response, a charge of $100 is enough to convince most students that they don’t really need to include that image in the on-line version.  Many times they could argue that their use was covered by fair dealing but even staff are very wary of the uncertainties of taking this approach.</p>
<p>Copyright fear – the vague but strong sense that I could be prosecuted for my use of someone else’s material: “I am just a lone researcher up against an organisation with (surely?) an army of legal advisors; there’s no-one here I can ask who will give me a straight answer (probably because they don’t really understand all the complexities themselves); and they are likely to be as afraid of giving me bad advice as I am of ‘risking it.’  Better to just play safe and forget about it.”  There are very few librarians or copyright officers who are legally qualified and it is therefore common for both these advisors and academic staff to err on the side of caution.  But I note here that I have only dealt with one formal complaint of copyright infringement in five years in this role.</p>
<p>Things are changing, though.  You can look at the question I asked our teaching staff about Creative Commons, turn the stats around, and say that over half do know something about it.  And there are a number of comments in the survey that indicate changes in practice, about staff becoming more aware of rights management in the light of technological changes in recent years.  There is even the odd evangelical comment bemoaning the barriers to advancing research and scholarship formed by subscription paywalls.  And we have a core collective of staff who are trying to spread the word, loosely organised around <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/openotago/">a blog</a> and a copyright community of practice.  But as the statistics I’ve provided suggest these are still to some extent lonely voices among the crowd.  To me this says that we –  in NZ at least – have some way to go before we can really say that the conversation has moved from ‘is it open access’ to ‘how open is it.’</p>
<p>And, turning my mind back to my own situation just 16 years ago, I wish someone had said to me at the outset of my research that I should be thinking about making my work available to the widest possible audience to read and re-use.  While theses have traditionally been regarded as unpublished works, I think we now do our research students a disservice if we breed this attitude into them.  This simply perpetuates the frustrations they suffer in trying to use material themselves.  As academics-in-training, we need to train them to think the way academics should – it’s just that we might need to convince more to think this way first.  Only then will the knowledge eco-system flourish and we can begin to shift the accent from open <em>access</em> to <em>open</em> access.</p>

<h5>By Penny Carnaby</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>What's happening in scholarly publishing?</em></p>

<p>There has been considerable discussion of scholarly publishing in the media recently.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Research Works Act and the Federal Research Public Access Act cthat generated a storm of protest across the world, including a boycott of Elsevier journals. This debate was significant in succeeding to get the issues about Open Access Publishing debated on the international stage.</p>
<p>In Great Britain, the <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf">Finch Report</a> expanded and deepened the debate on Open Access Publishing significantly. The report met with mixed reviews from Open Access proponents and the publishing industry. The greatest benefit of the report is that it brought the debate about ‘Green’ and ‘Gold’ Open Access to a much broader international audience. The likely funding and policy implications for research agencies was laid out clearly in this report but is, at this stage, unresolved.</p>
<p>In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has changed its policy position requiring NHMRC supported research to be deposited in <a href="http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/media/notices/2012/revised-policy-dissemination-research-findings">Open Access Research Repositories</a>. This initiative has prompted widespread discussion about Open Access Publishing in the Australian context.</p>
<p>There are many more examples: International events have brought the issues of Open Access Publishing into the spotlight and it is highly likely that the momentum towards Open Access Publishing will increase. There are clear signals of significant shifts in scholarly publishing conventions in New Zealand in the future.</p>
<p><em>What problems are we trying to address?</em></p>
<p>In essence, the conversation about scholarly publishing is trying to address several issues including:</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>better, faster, more affordable access to publicly funded research publications for everyone</li>

    <li>greater public access to research funded by the public purse</li>

    <li>the increasing disquiet that the process of scholarly communication has not really yet leveraged the potential, reach and scale of the internet</li>

    <li>the unacceptable and unaffordable escalating cost of research publishing and scholarly output, particularly relating to the larger science based aggregates and publishers</li>

    <li>understanding how we assess research impact, peer review processes and the integrity of the research process in an Open Access environment.</li>

</ol>
<p><em>What is open access?</em></p>
<p>While journals are now online, they are only available to people who pay a subscription or who are members of an institution who pays a subscription. Put simply open access uses digital technology to make research findings widely available. Researchers can make their work open access by one of two ways.</p>
<p>Publishing in an open access journal such as <em>PLoS One</em> is referred to as ‘gold’ open access. This may incur an article processing fee. While a few universities in Australia provide funds for open access publishing, the majority do not. Researchers may wish to consider including these fees in any grant proposals. Note that the 2012 ARC Discovery Grant funding rules allow 2% of the grant to be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Alternatively researchers can deposit a version of their work into a subject based repository such as arXiv.org, SSRN or RePEc, or an institutional repository. Every university in Australia and New Zealand has a repository for this purpose.</p>
<p><em>Doesn’t open access contravene copyright?</em></p>
<p>Generally the copyright of a paper is held by the author or the author’s institution prior to publication. The publisher’s agreement the author signs at the time of publication usually transfers the copyright of the work to the publisher. This then restricts use of the published work.</p>
<p>While putting the published version of a work into a repository (or onto Mendeley or Academia.edu) will contravene most publishers’ agreements, the majority of publishers allow an earlier version of a paper to be deposited into a repository.</p>
<p>The version most researchers make available is the accepted version – the final peer reviewed and corrected paper. This is sometimes called a post print. The Sherpa/RoMEO website (<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/</a>) lists the policies for most publishers.</p>
<p lang="en-NZ"><em>What are the alternatives to copyright?</em></p>

<p>The Creative Commons (<a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">http://creativecommons.org.au/</a>) is a set of internationally accepted licences which helps an organisation, author (or content) to share their work and indicate how they wish their work to be used. In New Zealand the government has adopted Creative Commons (see NZGOAL <a href="http://nzgoal.info/">http://nzgoal.info/</a>).</p>
<p>Alternatively there is an option for authors to amend their publisher’s agreement with an author addenda. There are online tools to generate these automatically (<a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.shtml">http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.shtml</a>)</p>
<p><em>What are the benefits of OA?</em></p>
<p>The pursuit of research is to increase global knowledge. Disseminating work through open access channels means that researchers in less resourced institutions, practitioners in the field and the general public can share findings. The taxpayer supports the research, the writing up of results, and the peer review and editing process. Open access allows these taxpayers to see these findings without having to pay to view.</p>
<p><em>What are some of the concerns with OA?</em></p>
<p>Some researchers express concern about plagiarism, particularly in terms of making theses available. However, while plagiarism occurs all the time, making work available in a repository clearly identifies the author as the owner of the work.</p>
<p>Publishers clearly have concerns that making work open access could affect subscriptions to their journals and threaten their viability. However, to date there is scant evidence that this will happen. The physics community has been making their work available through arXiv.org for over 20 years and this has not caused physics journals to fold.</p>
<p><em>How can universities support open access?</em></p>
<p>Universities can support the sharing of their researchers by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the university has a robust open access policy</li>

    <li>Considering an open access mandate</li>

    <li>Educating researchers on the benefits of open access</li>

    <li>Raising awareness of scholarly communication issues amongst the academic and library staff</li>

    <li>Encouraging authors to use Creative Commons licenses or author addenda</li>

</ul>
<p><em>What does this mean in the New Zealand context?</em></p>
<p>At this stage in New Zealand we are not seeing the magnitude of change that is being observed in Europe, USA and Australia. Having said this, there are strong Central Government signals about Open Access in relation to government data and information that may well transfer to research funding generally before long.</p>
