&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Where do you think Open Access is in Aotearoa? How far have we come?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“We've actually come a long way. If I look where we were when Creative Commons Aotearoa first joined the Royal Society, people in the research office had not heard of Open Access. It was seen as a radical idea then. We've come from not knowing what it was, to four NZ universities actually institutionalising positions on Open Access. We have Open Access weeks every year now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“So, you have to celebrate the progress of New Zealand. But if you step outside of New Zealand, we're really behind. The main concern for me is that we lack a commitment from research funders to put conditions on grants requiring researchers to share. This isn't just public funders – even private funders need to be moving in this direction. If you look overseas, funders like the National Institute for Health (NIH) have had mandates for years. Even private organisations like the Bill Gates Foundation now have these sorts of mandates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“When the NIH decided to have the OA mandate, they also put in place PubMedCentral. They provided the repository. Only now are the universities really exploiting the possibilities of the institutional repositories that libraries offer. It's very difficult to say that you need to publish Open Access when you do not give authors the option of going the green OA route. Some of the more prestigious journals do have Article Processing Charges – most don't, but many do. So it's understandable that the repositories are a big part of the solution. Without those repositories, it's hard to implement OA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In that sense, I think we are lagging behind. The one place where we are doing better is with open government data. New Zealand is operating in a slightly different order to the rest of the world, because they managed to get the government data mandate put in place quite well. I would like to see the same requirements pushed to funding research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“It shouldn't be that hard. We just need these organisations to say, 'if you want my money, here are the conditions'. Are researchers going to turn down that money? The funders are the ones that have the power. I think there is enough awareness that the fears that have held funders back are less than they were when the open access conversation started.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We have four Open Access commitments from universities. They are not as strong as they could be, but they are a start. But there haven't been any strong open data mandates. What's the future of open research data?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“With research data, you run into a slightly bigger problem. Universities have not figured out exactly what a good data management plan looks like, let alone the structure and resources we need to put behind the implementation of a good data management plan. So you can say, 'make your data available' – and there are solutions, like Figshare – but the institutions and the funders would like to see some wider national links, so they can be sure of the implementation of open data mandates. Australia has this, with ANDS. We don't have that in New Zealand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“So it isn't surprising that a mandate on data isn't something that we've had a mature conversation about so far. We haven't seen as many international examples of open research data mandates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“However, we are seeing many reputable journals like PeerJ requiring data sharing. As more journals require this, the requirement for better data management will come. It's very difficult to ask someone to share their data when it wasn't produced in such a way that makes it ready to publish. Open data requires a lot of behavioural change in the way we do science. We need to keep pushing for open data, though be aware that it will take some time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We need more examples of researchers like yourself successfully releasing their data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“I spend a lot of time on my data. I want to know that I'm not wasting my time. If I'm losing or destroying my data, and not releasing it for reuse, then from an institutional perspective, I have to ask: why are you hiring me? You wouldn't go to any other sector and say, let's get rid of all the work that was done five years ago. This work is part of our heritage, our historical record.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“A lot of the projects that I have are based on work that was done 20 years ago. Back then, there wasn't the technology to explore those questions further. I need access to that 20-year-old data. It's very hard to predict where data might end up having an impact. Destroying the data is a way of saying: my work is meant to have no impact. And then you think, how much money was spent on that project, how many people worked on it? And then you weigh those costs against the cost of storing the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“We were talking to Cable Green today, the Global Manager for Education at Creative Commons, and he said that all public grants should have a 10% allocation for implementation. We should have that in the research sector. Not for implementation, but for preservation. If you're not willing to give up 10% to preserve the work you do produce, then what you're saying is, I want your money for something that is not actually worth researching. If it's not worth preserving, then it's not worth doing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You'd think that this argument would be one that researchers would have difficulty disagreeing with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“There are other incentives. To get and keep a job, you need to play a certain game within the research system, and with the people you are assessing your performance. This is why you need to have the discussion with the university and with the funders. The government, too, has enormous power to say to the research community: here is what New Zealand values in research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“One of the problems here is that most of the decision-makers come from the non-digital age, like me. To them, the potential of the internet is not as obvious as it is to younger researchers. We don't necessarily understand what the internet offers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There's been a lot of activity over the years across New Zealand by a community of various advocates – from workshops and events to the passage of institutional policies. What's the most effective way forward for this community of people in support of OA, given that these people are often not in a position to push through change in their institution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“This is a good question: Is there a limit to who you can reach? When I talk to colleagues in the United States, they all deposit in PubMedCentral. They consider it so fundamental a part of the process, that it's no longer something that they have to think about. Our conversations are about values, and not conversations about everyday work. In New Zealand, we've often made the argument that this is the right thing to do. Its publicly funded, and the public should have access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Well, a lot of people don't agree with that. For some of us, this is an ethical position that we take, based on one ethical model. But perhaps for other people, with different values, we need to frame the issue in a different way. What is it that they care about, and how can OA help solve their problems? Maybe we need to change the conversation to match the motivations of those who do not buy in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“The grassroots movement supports the democratisation of knowledge. But that movement will have a limit. The question is: where's the value proposition that will get the others on board. The grassroots should continue to do as much as we can. But we should think about other ways to frame the issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A lot of researchers also don't have a strong position either way. Is it that they just want this problem to solved for them at a government, funder or institutional level?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“A lot of academics don't see access as a problem. They can get access to anything they want to read, because of their institution. And from the point of view of some academics, the people who need to read their research already have access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“The question is not access, then, but how broad the access should be. For me, it should be universal. But others do not feel that you would be able to read and interpret their articles in any knowledgeable way, and therefore you should be fine with a press release. The argument is essentially this: you can't understand my article, therefore you should not have access to my article, therefore you will never understand my article. Stay ignorant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“I like to think we can build a better society where we say: society pays me via the university and research grants. The person on the street is paying my salary. I like to think you have a right to ask me to explain why I'm doing this research, and why this money should be given to me. I should be held accountable. Maybe if we had more Open Access papers that were better written, we could even use them in secondary schools. Maybe this can lead to greater collaboration with teaching in schools. There is a potential for collaboration that is not exploited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“With the internet, too, young people will find information. It's up to researchers to decide whether that information is correct or not. I shouldn't spend my time writing blog posts. In my ideal world, there are no scientist bloggers, because there's no need for them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What about their students? They are training all these students, often to a postgraduate level, who will not have access to research when they graduate. There are more former students, with decent literacy and expertise in their discipline, than there are academics and researchers with library subscriptions by a factor of a thousand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“But what they say then is: just email me, and I'll give it to you. They consider their audience small enough to be managed by email. It's not understanding how big their audience is – and also how serendipitous discovery is. So, yes: my article might not be read by anyone. But if everyone publishes openly, then the probability of finding something useful increases exponentially. You never get more readership by diminishing distribution.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This post introduces some ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints. If you want to get involved, you can:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;* &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/23k8VZ9w/oer-sprints" target="_blank"&gt;join our organising group (on a platform called Loomio)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;* &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M9WOV-IHIIziMfVagWg_dklaHYslZN4KAf57_DOgixg/edit#gid=0" target="_blank"&gt;check out the existing task-list for the events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Let's Sprint!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, we announced our plans to organise &lt;a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/sprints" target="_blank"&gt;the Great 2016 Open Educational Resource Sprints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in my post last week, we’re getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, which are enabling teachers to legally share and collaborate. This is good news, of course, but the risk is that the policy becomes just a piece of paper, to which no one really pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s our opinion at CCANZ that it’s about time we put these policies into practice, and show how kiwi teachers can work together to make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the Sprints. But when you announce a new idea like an OER Sprint, you quickly find people asking a few quite important questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What's a Sprint, Anyway?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with the first one. What’s a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource sprint is an idea borrowed from the technology sector, where it is sometimes called a ‘hack.’ &lt;a href="https://www.govhack.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;The ‘GovHack’ weekends&lt;/a&gt; are one example of technologists, designers and a range of other volunteers coming together to make new products and services from open government data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the education sector, one of the big examples that inspired us was the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/02/announcing-the-creative-commons-media-studies-textbook/" target="_blank"&gt;Media Text Hack&lt;/a&gt; (there’s that word again), where a team of educators and researchers got together to write an open Media Studies textbook. It’s now an assigned undergraduate textbook at the University of Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example - which itself inspired the Media Text Hack team - was the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/oppikirjamaraton"&gt;Oppikirjamaraton&lt;/a&gt; (that’s Finnish for ‘textbook marathon). This event involved about thirty Finnish mathematics educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these events give us working models of how an OER Sprint might work. Both organising teams have also been open about the problems they had during the event (such as technology - surprise, surprise) and what they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Decisions, Decisions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these fantastic examples, there’s still a heap of details about the event that we need to figure out. We’ve decided to open up the process early, so everyone can see how our decisions are being made. Hopefully, at the end, we have a model that schools, associations and informal groups of teachers can use to sprint - or hack - their way to the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about? I’ll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at NZCommons &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/23k8VZ9w/oer-sprints" target="_blank"&gt;and in our open Loomio group&lt;/a&gt;, with other volunteer organisers. But here's a few to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;How long should it last for? Some sprints last for two days, others just one. Some sprints keep strict, family-friendly time-frames, while others keep working deep into the night. My feeling is that we ought to keep it short and sweet - i.e a busy 9/10-5 - for either one or two days, though with an expectation than many participants won’t be able to commit for the full period.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Technology - the bane of many such events. We’ll need to find a technical platform that works for everyone. My initial thinking is that Google Docs will work fine for small teams, and is a technology many teachers already use. Some bigger projects with many more collaborators  have had issues with using Google Docs, and more technical platforms - like Github - have also been problematic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators. What skills do we need? And what’s the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts (like academics), facilitators and other volunteers? My feeling is that we need to keep the focus of the event as ‘by teachers, for teachers’, with other volunteers serving to support the needs of the participants teachers. At the same time, we want to take advantage of the collective expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;What’s a ‘resource’? Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling is that a ‘resource’ is whatever the heck participants decide to make on the day, and that this should be the decision of each individual team.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Team formation: what constitutes a team? How many people? 3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure about this.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;What about virtual participation? If we’re working on Google docs, this is fine - though virtual collaboration can breed those dreaded Technological Problems, which we’ll want to avoid. But we shouldn’t put any barriers on people participating, either.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;What will the events actually look like? My assumption is that it will involve people sitting at tables, talking and typing. We should try to minimise the amount of scene-setting at the beginning, and look to have a plethora of helpers to solve problems as they arise. This will involve giving clear guidance beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about at the beginning is probably unavoidable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;How much does it cost? From our point of view, there are two sorts of costs: event costs; and outreach costs, before and after the event. For the event, we’ll need funding or in-kind sponsorship to cover food, drink, venue, technology and other incidental costs. For the outreach, we’ll need funding to get resources on CC and OER to as many teachers as possible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Finally, how many events? We’re not sure, yet, though before the end of the year, we should make some initial committments. I’m obviously keen to have them anywhere and everywhere, though this will depend on us getting strong local support.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last plug: if you want to help answer these questions, &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/23k8VZ9w/oer-sprints" target="_blank"&gt;join our Loomio&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Creative Commons policies in kiwi schools</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/do-i-really-have-to-think-about-copyright.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;CC Policies for All!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/about/who-we-are/"&gt;we at CCANZ&lt;/a&gt; - that’s Elizabeth and me and a broad community of volunteers - have been working on a sprawlingly ambitious project that has since become known as ‘CC in Schools.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the main part of &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/" target="_blank"&gt;CC in Schools&lt;/a&gt; has been advocating for individual schools to pass Creative Commons policies. These policies, approved at a Board of Trustees level, simply give permission for teachers to share their resources using a CC licence. We’ve written about this a tonne--including in just about every teaching publication in the country--so I won’t go into it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re pretty happy with the progress. We’ve got around 100 schools on board - and probably quite a few more that haven’t got in touch with us - including some of the largest schools in the country, such as Hutt Valley High School, Burnside High School and Middleton Grange. We’re going to continue to beaver away, and are working at partnering more formally with some of the bigger educational fish in Aotearoa, to help scale this work to every other school in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;So We Have This CC Policy...&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point of these CC policies was never just to have some nice-sounding pieces of paper in various school policy packs. CC in Schools was (and is) motivated by a desire to: a) make it less risky for teachers to share their work; and b) grow a commons of open educational resources. This will save time and money and ensure that the best resources in the country are available to anyone who wants them, free of technical, price and legal restrictions on reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advocating for these policies, we’ve faced one basic hurdle - and, by the way, this hurdle is categorically not that schools and teachers don’t want to share their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a hurdle that’s best summed up by a lovely cartoon that Jessica Coates, from our mates at CC Australia, likes to use in her presentations. It’s something that all of us (except, perhaps, for IP lawyers) can sympathise with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copyright-Law.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-753 size-full" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copyright-Law.jpg" alt="Copyright Law" width="532" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Slide 12 from "&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Jessicacoates/open-access-glam-34793864"&gt;Open Access GLAM&lt;/a&gt;" by Jessica Coates. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://Slide%2012%20from%20%22Open%20Access%20GLAM%22%20by%20Jessica%20Coates.%20Made%20available%20under%20a%20CC%20BY%203.0%20unported%20licence."&gt;CC BY 3.0 unported licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Do I Really Have To Think About Copyright?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the hurdle: most people just don’t want to spend their time thinking about copyright. Those who dip their toes into the copyright waters tend to find out pretty quickly that copyright isn’t intuitive; it isn’t common sense: and it doesn’t work in the way that many people would like. They also find that some parts of copyright -- like permitted uses for educators -- can get quite complex, and they generally have a hard time getting straight answers (sometimes because those straight answers simply don’t exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright discussions also have a habit of becoming overly moralistic (‘stealing’, ‘ripping off’), technical (‘see section 21.2 of the 1994 Copyright Act’) or otherwise devolving into a lecture (‘In 1709, the Statute of Anne...’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this is unavoidable. Copyright isn’t going away, and unless New Zealand decides to adopt more liberal and broad fair use exceptions in our upcoming review, some of the complexity isn’t going to go away, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Spend Less Time Thinking about Copyright&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of it really is avoidable. A big part of the problem with copyright and educational resources in New Zealand is that creators effectively outsource thinking about copyright to the end user. Even when works are made to be freely shared and adapted - like many educational resources - the user has the burden of figuring out whether their use is legal. They may choose not to use the work at all; they may use it, and risk breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we need more creators to use CC. It brings me back to one of the goals of CC in Schools (worth keeping in mind with policies like this): to grow a commons of educational resources where &lt;em&gt;the end user doesn’t need to think about copyright&lt;/em&gt;. All they need to is follow the human-readable licence terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using CC licences can reduce the amount of time teachers (and others) spend thinking about copyright, and also reduce any legal risks, by ensuring that the people using your resources know exactly what they can (and cannot) do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a challenge. While large sharing portals are making it easier than ever to add a licence, it can seem like One More Thing. But remember: by adding a licence, you’re ensuring that others, further down the line, can spend less time thinking about copyright. And that, I think, is something we (and maybe even lawyers) can all get behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two week ago, the New Zealand Open Government Data Programme &lt;a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/" target="_blank"&gt;announced the release of NZGOAL version 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, NZGOAL is a great piece of government policy, which was approved by Cabinet in 2010. In essence, NZGOAL advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organisations, like Public Service Departments, are directed to use NZGOAL; state services agencies are strongly encouraged, while school Boards of Trustees are invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years on, we’ve seen a reasonably steady uptake on NZGOAL. Public Service Departments are getting steadily better at using open licensing by default, especially data-heavy agencies like Statistics New Zealand, Land Information New Zealand and Ministry for the Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also seeing uptake in the GLAM sector, with Te Papa, National Library of New Zealand and Auckland Museum all making commitments to open licensing. Schools are also beginning to use CC - we’ve currently got around ninety schools with CC policies, and more to come in the future. Local government and research institutions are also beginning to make moves towards greater openness, which is great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As NZGOAL gradually became the default setting for the release of an increasing number copyright and non-copyright works, New Zealand Open Government Data Programme decided that the policy and guidance materials it uses needed updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important change was the simplification of the review and release process flow-chart. You can read about the other changes &lt;a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/#changelog" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, though -- from our point of view at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, at least -- is that Creative Commons HQ finished its exhaustive process of developing &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/version4" target="_blank"&gt;the 4.0 version of the CC licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version of NZGOAL recommended the use of the Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licences. These licences had been ‘ported’ for New Zealand law. If you’re interested in learning more about this, &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/whats-licence/" target="_blank"&gt;check out this interview we conducted with Andrew Matangi&lt;/a&gt;, who led the initial porting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing wrong with the 3.0 NZ licences, the arrival of the 4.0 licences is a welcome opportunity to ensure that everyone in the world is using the same CC licences. The CC licence chooser -- which many people use to get their standard licensing statement -- also puts some hurdles in the way of those people looking for the earlier, ported licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the NZGOAL team have decided to officially recommend the 4.0 licences. While agencies can still decide to use the older 3.0 NZ licences if they want, the guidance material provided by NZGOAL will recommend the 4.0 licences. Over time, we can expect more and more agencies to go down the CC 4.0 road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you with works licensed under CC 3.0 NZ -- or any other licence -- you don’t need to worry. This licence is still legally valid and robust, and can still be used to licence your work. And if you want to change, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/nzgoal.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 11:08:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Open Education on the road</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/open-education-on-the-road.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By Matt McGregor&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we went on the road with Billy Meinke, now with the University of Hawaii and formerly of Creative Commons International. Billy was in the country for the Open Source // Open Society conference (which you can read more about &lt;a title="Education: a commons-based future" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/education-a-commons-based-future/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). We used Billy's arrival as an excuse to organise events promoting open textbooks in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, beginning in Auckland on 13 April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each event took a similar structure. First, Fabiana Kubke or I introduced Creative Commons, and outlined what Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand wanted to see in the sector. Next, Billy talked about some of the open education projects he's been involved in, including the $2billion TAACCCT project to develop open workplace training resources. Finally, Erika Pearson, Simon Hart and Richard White from the University of Otago talked about the Media Text Hack, a successful project to develop an open educational resource -- in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erika, Richard and Simon didn't use slides, &lt;a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/hackpack" target="_blank"&gt;but have handily put together the Hack Pack&lt;/a&gt;, a one-stop shop for all things Media Text Hack related, including a ‘how to’ guide, discussions and reflections, and sample plans/documents for running your own open textbook hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne Mackintosh is the Director of the &lt;a title="OERF" href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Resource Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (OERF), an international non-profit organisation based in Dunedin. The OERF aims to promote the development and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) as a sustainable and renewable resource. Wayne also holds the UNESCO/COL/ICDE Chair in OER based at Otago Polytechnic and the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Wayne and began by asking about how he entered the world of Open Educational Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spent the majority of my academic career working in open distance learning, including the University of South Africa, the biggest provider of distance learning in Africa. In 2002, I moved to New Zealand to help set up a distance and flexible learning centre at the University of Auckland. The idea behind the centre was to promote collaboration in elearning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the state of open education in 2001?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to point out that ‘open education’ is an umbrella term. When we talk about open education, we’re talking about not only open educational resources, but also open source software, open governance, open policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But in 2001, open education was virtually unheard of, and there was very little happening in terms of OER development. The concept itself wasn’t coined until a conference hosted by UNESCO in 2002. This is ironic, of course, as teaching is all about sharing knowledge freely -- it’s fundamental to what teachers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In those days, we focused on the development and adoption of open source software, as this was considered the best way to introduce the concept of open education to the tertiary sector in New Zealand. Thanks to significant investment in that area from the government of the day, we were able to assist with the development of the open source learning management system Moodle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Partly as a result of that work, New Zealand has the highest rates of adoption of Moodle in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did OER develop over the decade?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the first decade, the focus of the movement  was on advocacy -- just getting the message out and educating folks about open education. As the advocacy efforts developed, the donor community began to fund OER development. The William and Flora Hewitt Foundation in particular has funded a number of the OER projects, including projects like the open courseware initiative from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing the fruits of some of that early development now, with the adoption of open policy for major projects like the $2billion TAACCCT fund for educational resources for community colleges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happened after leaving the University of Auckland? How did you get from there to the OERF?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After the University of Auckland, I moved to represent New Zealand at the &lt;a title="Commonwealth of Learning" href="http://www.col.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Commonwealth of Learning&lt;/a&gt;, based in Vancouver, where my work focused on the adoption of open educational practices and open source software in education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After leaving the COL, I moved to set up the Open Education Resource Foundation. After looking around the world, I saw that the only higher education institution with an open policy for educational resources was &lt;a title="Otago Polytech IP policy" href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic:_An_IP_policy_for_the_times" target="_blank"&gt;Otago Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt; -- which is how the OERF came to be based in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Happily, the Council of Otago Polytechnic were brave and forward-thinking enough to take us on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does the OERF do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The OERF has two flagship initiatives. The first is &lt;a title="Wikieducator" href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank"&gt;Wikieducator&lt;/a&gt;, which is a platform for the global education community to share and edit educational resources with 58,000 registered account holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The second is the OERu, which is a consortium of higher education institutions committed to providing truly free and open education, including open courses using only open educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The mission of the OERu is to develop a sustainable ecosystem of open educational resources. All partner institutions commit to produce two free courses based entirely on OER, providing free access to all learners. Assessment services are then provided on a cost-recovery model. This model enables us to reduce the costs of tuition to the learner to as little as 20% of current costs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s next? What does the future of OER look like?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There’s still a long way to go. From my perspective, OER is inevitable -- no model of knowledge production can match the efficiency of OER. The real challenge, though, is how long it takes for institutions to develop a culture of sharing. Working for cultural change within traditional and conservative institutions -- as higher education institutions tend to be -- takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It’s important that we keep working to develop skills within the tertiary sector. This is still relatively little knowledge or expertise in OER, and this will need to change in order to make OER development and use mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From a policy level, we need a stronger commitment from central government and tertiary education institutions to ensure that all educational resources produced by publicly funded institutions are made openly available. People often ask about the ‘sustainability’ of OER. It’s not rocket science: we already fund the production of open educational resources. We just need to make sure the resources that are already produced within universities are made available as OER using Creative Commons licences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should New Zealand tertiary education institutions do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It’s essential that institutions pass policies to support the development and use of OER. This is going to take some time. One of the difficulties in working the tertiary sector is that institutions are competitive with each other. We say that if institutions are worried about competition, they should join the OERu. As I said earlier, our open model enables us to reduce the costs of tuition to the learner to 20% of costs at existing mainstream institutions. The OERu is the new competition."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been travelling around Aotearoa spreading the word about Open Educational Resources for New Zealand schools. In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded the slides below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been travelling around Aotearoa spreading the word about open access and open licensing for local Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM). In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded a video of one of the sessions plus the slides below, along with a short summary of what they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgNF5HZTBsU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Matt McGregor and Elizabeth Heritage, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Elizabeth began by introducing Creative Commons licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. They then noted that, while new technologies had provided heritage organisations new opportunities to share their digital collections for reuse, copyright and licensing was still a significant barrier. Usage rights statements, they said, were often vague, overly restrictive and not standardised across the sector. They then ran through three specific recommendations, outlined in the slides, before giving a brief introduction to the licences themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702250" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Keitha Booth, New Zealand Open Government Information and Data Programme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keitha introduced the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, which advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector. Keitha noted that the Open Government Data and Information Programme had expanded its focus to local government. She outlined the NZGOAL adoption process, and the policy framework for each institution, both of which are detailed in the slides below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702435" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria outlined Te Papa's experiences with Creative Commons licensing, beginning with the Rita Angus podcasts in 2008. Victoria noted that CC licensing these podcasts had enabled them to be used by other institutions touring the exhibition -- without Te Papa having to write detailed usage agreements. After running through several other CC projects, Victoria discussed the download project, which has so far released over 48,000 images for free high-resolution download. Victoria noted that usage was much greater than predicted at the beginning of the project, and that it was being used for a range of purposes. Victoria closed her presentation by outlining the challenges to open access and open licensing for the GLAM sector, and highlighting the approach taken in response to these challenges thus far by Te Papa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702446" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, DigitalNZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing DigitalNZ and its mission, Thomasin showed the famous 'magic hat' diagram, which outlines how content from individuals and organisations around New Zealand is harvested by the DigitalNZ and made more easily searchable by the aforementioned magic hat (otherwise known as the DigitalNZ API). She then gave an overview of DigitalNZ's approach to rights, and pointed out some of the common issues faced by DigitalNZ as it attempts to provide clear rights information to end users. Thomasin argued that the point of working through these rights issues was to help produce "a world in which our shared cultural heritage is open to all, regardless of their background. A world in which people are no longer passive consumers of cultural content created by an elite, but contribute, participate, create and share." Thomasin concluded with several standout local and international open GLAM case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702442" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, Alexander Turnbull Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark began by noting that the internal debates around use and reuse within the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa repeated debates that are taking place in society at large. Many of the issues around reusing collection items were difficult, and many of them turned on the notion of trust. Mark then noted that rights statements across the sector were inconsistent, and that the National Library of New Zealand had developed a set of policy principles to address this inconsistency, which are outlined in the slides. Implementation, he said, was ongoing, though three issues currently being addressed were donor and depositor agreements, a flowchart to guide the release process, and improving the rights statements and licensing on indigenous knowledge works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Allison Brown, Digital Services Coordinator, University of Otago Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison discussed the use of Creative Commons licensing within the University of Otago library. In particular, she gave her experience in discussing CC licensing with rights holders, applying CC licensing in a library context, supporting the use of CC by others, managing the use of CC and promoting CC to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the morning of 25 March, I found myself helping Fabiana Kubke and Cameron McLean run a workshop for a hodge-podge of enthusiastic librarians, researchers and infrastructure providers in a conference room in Queenstown, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop was held in Queenstown as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.eresearch.org.nz/content/eresearch-nz-2015" target="_blank"&gt;eResearch NZ 2015 conference&lt;/a&gt;, organised by the National e-Science Infrastructure (NeSI), Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ) and New Zealand Genomics Limited (NZGL). The conference brought together researchers and infrastructure providers to, as the name of the conference suggests, discuss the future of eResearch in Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were there to tease out how we might develop open educational resources on Reproducible, Open and Collaborative Science research (i.e. research that ROCS - thanks to Peter Murray-Rust for the splendid acronym-ing. And yes, the allusion to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_%28mythology%29" target="_blank"&gt;the mythical Roc&lt;/a&gt; is entirely intentional.). These open resources will be incorporated into a cross-disciplinary 700-level (i.e. postgraduate) course at the University of Auckland, though we are hopeful that the resources could be used for a range of different purposes across the New Zealand tertiary education sector and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had come well prepared. Fabiana and Cameron had held a similar workshop in Auckland in September last year, and had a heap of data from those sessions regarding which skills and tools researchers valued. While at Mozfest in 2014, Fabiana had also worked with the wonderful Kaitlin Thainey (from Mozilla Science Lab) and the equally wonderful Billy Meinke (then at CC International) to help develop a flexible and modular structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to cover. Open research, broadly defined, refers to a research process that effectively ‘bakes in’ openness from the beginning. This ensures that other researchers -- as well as people who aren’t researchers or experts in any given field -- can follow the research process, which makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and to reproduce the research in other contexts (&lt;a href="http://www.jove.com/blog/2012/05/03/studies-show-only-10-of-published-science-articles-are-reproducible-what-is-happening" target="_blank"&gt;which is not always easy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason to make research more open is to give access to a range of groups currently almost entirely excluded from research. These include policy makers, advocates, citizen scientists, journalists, teachers and students outside of large research institutions -- as well as the general public, who have often paid for the research in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big issue, and copyright and open licensing is only one aspect. As the picture above suggests, there are heaps of skills needed to practise open research; moreover, many of these skills are generally &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; taught in the existing science education system. How, then, do we teach open research skills, to make open research standard practice across the research sector?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the difficulties is that most established researchers don’t know quite what ‘open research’ looks like, and generally lack the basic knowledge, skills and tools required make their research truly open. This is a problem, because established researchers -- like established teachers, librarians, government officials and Public Leads of Creative Commons -- pass on the norms of research practice on to their students, and thus reproduce the system as they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution devised by Fabiana and team is to start from the middle: i.e, with postgraduate and early-career researchers. Rather than take on the twin challenge of immediately scaling a course to several thousand undergraduates and attempting to change the practices of late-career researchers, the aim is to train the next generation of researchers and lecturers in the ethos and practices of open research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did we cover? Rather than lecture at a room of experts, we decided to mine them for their expertise. Employing a delicate mix of table arrangements, peer pressure and sugary incentives, we had the attendees arrange themselves into five groups, and from there Cameron gave them a series of activities so they could share the skills and tools necessary to conduct open research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response was fantastic - so fantastic that I could barely keep up. One of the initial questions - what is missing from our existing modules? - received at least 18 responses, and it seemed like the following question - which skills are most important? - could have had a 75-minute workshop all of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop ended with a discussion on some of the practicalities of teaching open science, a discussion that sadly had to be cut short at the end of our allotted 75 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the session, Cameron, Fabiana and I met to debrief, and agreed that the skills the open resources would need to address - such as research communication, data management, collaboration, versioning and visualisation - were notably &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; specific to computer scientists, and, more notably, not even limited to scientists. While there were some technical and domain-specific suggestions (one of my notes reads “optimising in a parallel universe”: how great does that sound?), the groups soon began to focus on skills and capabilities that would be useful to researchers across every discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practising what we preach, Cameron has shared &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubke/MozFest2014-OS-Skills-Curriculum/wiki/eResearchNZ-2015-Workshop" target="_blank"&gt;all our existing data and resources on Github&lt;/a&gt;. My rough notes from the session are &lt;a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/6iKGo4Qi1E" target="_blank"&gt;on an etherpad here&lt;/a&gt;, and will be expanded as we bring the notes from participants together. We (and by we I mean Cameron) also has a pile of written notes from the participants that we’re going to gather together and publish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Data</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/teaching-reproducible-open-collaborative-science.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 08:05:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On Recent Changes at CC Aotearoa</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/recent-changes-cc-aotearoa.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, we at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand have been thinking about an obvious but difficult question: what does a successful Creative Commons affiliate look like? This question has two interrelated parts. First, how should we structure ourselves? Second, what are our priorities? What are our goals? What should we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sometimes seems like every CC affiliate has taken a different answer to that first question, which is hardly a surprise, given the diversity of the global affiliate community. Some affiliates are part of larger NGOs or thinktanks; some are located in faculties of law; others are more or less independent entities. Some larger countries, like Canada and India, have multiple affiliates, which share a range of legal and advocacy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has always been part of a larger NGO, though over the last year we've been slowly moving towards greater independence. In July, we left our long term host, the Royal Society of New Zealand, who had provided everything from office space to accounting, governance and managerial support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In moving to our new host, the wonderful Open Education Resources Foundation, our advisory board and staff took on more responsibility, in return for greater control over our budget and leaner decision making processes. Simply put, we chose this new structure because it enabled us to do much more with our limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the second question: as part of this move to greater independence, we also started rethinking what we do, day-to-day. The first thing we did, in late 2013, was move away from the breakdown of projects we'd borrowed from CCHQ. We decided that the four headings – 'Culture', 'Science', 'Government', and 'Education' – were too vague and broad to adequately represent our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Culture,' for example, encompasses GLAM, creative arts and indigenous knowledge, which are three distinct projects. The same was true of education, which encompassed both our schools OER project and our OER project in the tertiary education sector -- which actually have relatively little to do with each other. Finally, the former literature teacher in me bristled that 'Science' was being used as a shorthand for 'open access to scholarly publishing.' As a result, we ditched 'Science' for 'Open Access to Research', and created a new project area for 'Open Data.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the process, we had created eight new project areas – replacing the original four – which you can see &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;on the front page of our website&lt;/a&gt;. For each of these projects, we developed an introduction and brought together a growing range of resources. We also developed a series of overarching goals (which we shared in our roadmap), and we are currently developing &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jglu6rp8aH7y35BEMyzbgKt5tA7psDqAbgOrS93kjOM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"&gt;a detailed workplan&lt;/a&gt;, which will outline how these goals will be achieved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, these goals centre on CCANZ assisting a range of public-sector organisations with open policy adoption and implementation, with a particular focus on the heritage, research and schools sectors. Our workplan focuses on providing a heap of in-person workshops and resources, including targeted policy toolkits, brochures, posters and discussion pieces from the CC community – which we have started to publish on our new sister site, NZCommons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this focus on open policy, we seem to be moving in the same direction as many other CC affiliates and NGOs (as the establishment of the &lt;a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Policy Network&lt;/a&gt; suggests). While we still support licence adoption in the creative sector, and still support sensible copyright reform, open policy advocacy has become the clearest path for a small NGO like CCANZ to contribute to lasting social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our success will largely depend on the growing number of volunteers and champions in and around our public institutions willing to advocate for open licensing to their colleagues, managers, clients and boards. A key part of our job – and one of the reasons we provide workshops and produce resources – will be to support the work these champions are doing to grow the commons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/recent-changes-cc-aotearoa.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 13:22:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
