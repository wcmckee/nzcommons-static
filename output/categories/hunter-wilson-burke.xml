&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand we have 33 public tertiary educational institutions, comprising eight universities, 20 institutes of technology, and three wānanga (Māori centres of tertiary learning). Under the Education Act 1989, all of these institutions have the authority to award degrees recognised by the New Zealand National Qualifications Authority. While the breadth of tertiary provision is generally positive, the current system also causes some problems -- problems that open licensing may be able to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diverse tertiary sector combined with New Zealand's widely distributed population has meant there is an extensive national network of institutions offering a core set of qualifications throughout the country. However, the historical funding model employed by the New Zealand government has encouraged competition between tertiary institutions. While this can be an incentive for providing high-quality educational services, it can also lead to unnecessary inefficiencies. Competition between institutions often means that teachers and researchers are forced to spend much of their time creating resources that already exist elsewhere in the educational system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current intellectual property models used by most New Zealand tertiary institutions further exacerbate inefficiencies, causing the production of unnecessary duplications of qualifications and materials. For instance, in 2012 there were 62 registered qualifications available in New Zealand intended for the education and training of tertiary teachers. It seems counterintuitive for so many variants of the same qualification to produce, from scratch, their own course materials, especially when teachers and researchers could be working in collaboration to create comprehensive and adaptable Open Educational Resources (OERs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adoption of OERs in New Zealand's tertiary sector could provide an alternative to the duplication of course materials by competing qualifications. Generic and widespread resources created under an open licence would allow New Zealand institutions to collaborate together. Reusing and remixing resources across institutions can mean that high-quality learning materials are widely dispersed and accessible to the general population. The adoption of OER courses, or at least course materials for less specialised qualifications, would provide an excellent testing ground. This would allow for New Zealand's tertiary education systems to explore the potential of open education as a mechanism for reducing internal costs and production inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student at Victoria University, my main expense -- barring course costs -- is textbooks. Often these are simply a collection of photocopied excerpts from various books and journal articles. While textbook costs vary, it is not unusual to spend thousands of dollars over the course of a degree for books that are often used for little over three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began &lt;a title="MIT OpenCourseWare" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;OpenCourseWare&lt;/a&gt;, a project in which they began publishing their course materials under Creative Commons licences, making them freely available to the public for reuse and repurposing. Since then several universities have followed suit, openly publishing course materials and making them available to the commons. In New Zealand a number of tertiary institutions are already part of the &lt;a title="OERu" href="http://oeru.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Resources Universitas&lt;/a&gt; (OERu), an independent network that offers free online courses for students worldwide. Despite the benefits of Open Educational Resources (OERs) and their increasing popularity among tertiary institutions, the movement has not garnered widespread publicity or institutionalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my time at Victoria University I have noticed small changes taking place. It is becoming increasingly common for courses to be based on a series of online journal articles instead of a textbook. However, these journal articles are usually not openly licensed, and are instead made available to students and staff members of Victoria University through agreements the university has with other institutions. This means they cannot legally be shared outside of the university domain and are vulnerable to changes in intellectual property law. For example, current negotiations regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement could jeopardise the use of several online journal articles at university. Thus, while these changes indicate an awareness and interest in moving forwards from expensive textbooks, they do not address the wider issue of open education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with several professors at Victoria University to hear their perspectives on the matter. Ideologically, staff members were very supportive of open education policies being adopted in universities, speaking positively about the benefits of OERs. These include expanding the scope of education, especially to those in financially restrictive situations; enabling them to enrich their students’ learning experience with increased resources; and allowing students to easily teach others what they have learned. Staff were also very enthusiastic about publishing their works openly, allowing them to easily share and distribute their work without worrying about restrictive copyright laws. Despite the ideological alignment and positivity shown by staff, many were at a loss concerning the logistical implementation of OERs and how it would affect the university financially and commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conversations demonstrated the necessity of increased visibility of the open education movement and its proposed solutions to current problems. There are a number of economic benefits for educational institutions using OERs: for example, the money saved through using existing OERs from reliable institutions; and efficiencies created from the collective action of several institutions creating a large depository of academically sound OERs across a wide range of disciplines and through institutional backing and grassroots community support. The formulation of alternative business models allowing for the sustained production of OERs and an increased awareness of the alternative forms of copyright available is an integral aspect of furthering the use of OERs in tertiary institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
