&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As a member of the New Zealand book trade, as well as being the Communications Lead at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, I’m always on the look-out for stories of Kiwis licensing their books under Creative Commons. Recently I caught up with Ann Calhoun, whose ebook &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.artsandcraftsnz.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Arts &amp;amp; Crafts Design: "like yet not like" nature: sources for a New Zealand story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is lic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ensed under a Creative Commons &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) 4.0 New Zealand licence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Calhoun is an art historian and researcher. Initially working in the patent world, she retrained as an art historian, then worked at the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council, the National Art Gallery, the City Gallery (Wellington) and did contract work for Te Papa. She published &lt;i&gt;The Arts &lt;/i&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;i&gt; Crafts movement in New Zealand &lt;/i&gt;(AUP 2000) and curated &lt;i&gt;Simplicity &lt;/i&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;i&gt; &lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;Splendour &lt;/i&gt;for the Christchurch Art Gallery (2004-5). She has written extensively about women’s history and arts and crafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The blurb to her book states: “Over decades of privileged study of the Arts &amp;amp; Crafts in New Zealand, I became aware of a body of beautiful designs on paper. Almost all were by women, almost all had never been realised on fabric or wallpaper or on any other media or end product, and most had never been exhibited or published. The purpose of the present study is to right this wrong.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ArtsandCraftsNZ_Ann_Calhoun_2015-Cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-823 size-large" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ArtsandCraftsNZ_Ann_Calhoun_2015-Cover-1024x768.jpg" alt="Ebook cover: Arts and Crafts Design by Ann Calhoun" width="1024" height="768"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ebook cover: Reverend Doris Tutill, Wisteria design suitable for embroidery, 1933, watercolour; Macmillan Brown Library, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand (photo: Karl Valpy, Christchurch). Licensed CC BY-NC-ND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ann’s book is &lt;a href="http://www.artsandcraftsnz.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;available as an ebook only&lt;/a&gt;. She says: “The ebook is 350 pages and over 300 images. Publication costs for a regular book would have been prohibitive for a decent print run. I wanted New Zealanders to recognise that their cultural history included an Arts &amp;amp; Crafts movement. In today’s visual culture an illustrated book has understandably more attractions than text alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ann chose to make her ebook available for free download under a CC BY-NC-ND licence so as many people as possible could read it. She says: “Licensing my book under Creative Commons was a ‘no-brainer’. I come from a background in patents and art history, and questions of copyright have always been of interest. CC means that younger and older audiences – anyone interested in design or the Arts &amp;amp; Crafts or almost anything! - can have easy access to the CC ebook. In every way, CC was an exciting option.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/James-Johnstone-table-lamp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-825 size-medium" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/James-Johnstone-table-lamp-176x300.jpg" alt="James Johnstone table lamp" width="176" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; James Johnstone (head of Design and Crafts at the Canterbury College School of Art from 1926 to 1958), “Table Lamp”, oxidised silver on copper, c1932; Private collection (photo: J. Thomson, Christchurch). Licensed CC BY-NC-ND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Being able to publish such a highly illustrated book depended on Ann’s ability to access and reuse GLAM collections around the country. She says: “Using CC, I was aware of the generosity of so many people, in particular professional and amateur photographers. Researchers always depend on those they interview and I was always thrilled to visit. Libraries and public art collections were exceptional – the Alexander Turnbull Library supplied a significant number of images. Staff everywhere were wonderful and interested in the use of CC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“And in my thanks I must include the designer Gray Hodgkinson, who with Rosemary Tonk make up DesignSpace. With such an exciting design and card flyer, I knew that readers could access the story by image and later refer to the text for a closer reading. An eminent New Zealand librarian commented on the quality of the images and pronounced himself a convert to digital books – and hopefully to Creative Commons. CC gives access where access may previously have been denied.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His art can be found at artcontrol.me and is available under a Creative Commons Attribution (BY) licence. William is also a supporter and user of open source software, and is passionate about early childhood education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I use Creative Commons as an artist in the hope that it helps promote my artwork, and to make the world a better place,” says William. “Others may find uses for my art and even make money from it, good on them!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/themilkcollective-color.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-795" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/themilkcollective-color.png" alt="themilkcollective-color" width="600" height="424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "The Milk Collective - Colour" by Wiliam McKee, via artcontrol.me. &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Licensed CC-BY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William seriously became interested in drawing after leaving high school and attending UCOL in Palmerston North. There he had a drawing tutor, Mark, who inspired him to keep a drawing journal. William gained the habit of carrying a sketchbook wherever he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time at Palmerston North School of Design, William created the site artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee. It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress, switching later to Nikola. He later also switched this to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian, which is used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While William was always interested in using a Creative Commons licence, he at first chose to use a more restrictive Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence for his artworks, though soon chose to use the liberal Attribution (BY) licence. William doesn’t see many reasons for artists to use NC licences, and finds it especially problematic when NC licensing is used by governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, “Tax payers have already paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences (perhaps even public domain/creativecommons zero). This allows the most freedom for people to do what they like with the content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the “Non-Commercial licences are hard to interpret,&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140326/11405526695/german-court-says-creative-commons-non-commercial-licenses-must-be-purely-personal-use.shtml" target="_blank"&gt; as was noted in a German court case in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which strongly limited the interpretation of NC to ‘personal use.’ Similar problems with the interpretation of NC could exist in other countries. This is why I think government - and everyone, in fact - should avoid the NC licence. I would actually prefer that the NC licence not exist in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the majority of New Zealand government works released under CC seems to be under CC BY, though he is concerned that some schools seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has also adapted the work of another Creative Commons licensed artist, Jem Yoshioka, which is featured below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jem-color.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-794" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jem-color.png" alt='"Jem-colour" by William McKee, via artcontrol.me. Licensed CC-BY.' width="600" height="424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "Jem-colour" by William McKee, via artcontrol.me. &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Licensed CC-BY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion, where he began to focus on life drawing, using GIMP, an open source drawing and design tool. William began by painting on a windows desktop and laptop, later switching to Fedora and Debian. Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn. During this period, William would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference. At the bottom of the page he would sign with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write ‘cc by’ on the piece of original artwork. These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre, where he would work collaboratively with kids, often on the same piece of art, using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil. He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these works under a CC BY licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me. He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside, with children requested that he draw comic book characters like the Hulk, Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School. Swarms of school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him. They were often blown away from how quickly he worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A hope of mine,” William says, “was the children would learn that art was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, helping to spread the word about Creative Commons licensing in the Hamilton region. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/about/volunteer-for-creative-commons-aotearoa-new-zealand/" target="_blank"&gt;If you want to volunteer, get in touch!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Arts</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/artist-william-mckee-discusses-creative-commons-open-source-and-open-education.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 10:55:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NZ On Screen and Nga Taonga Sound &amp; Vision</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/nz-on-screen-and-nga-taonga-sound-vision.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY IRENE GARDINER AND SARAH DAVY&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what the situation was with regards to accessing Kiwi films and TV programmes? Irene Gardiner, Content Director for NZ On Screen, and Sarah Davy, Head of Operations at Ngā Taonga, write about their work to make our national wealth of audio-visual content as available as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Irene Gardiner writes about NZ On Screen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="NZ On Screen" href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ On Screen&lt;/a&gt;'s primary purpose is to showcase the New Zealand screen industry. Making television, film and music video available to New Zealanders both here and around the world is vital to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly seven years in existence, we have around 3,000 titles on the website, and they are all free to view for reference and enjoyment. Our site visitor numbers have grown every year so far, and in this current financial year will go over a million for the first time. New Zealanders' appetite for pop culture nostalgia and  interest in our screen heritage are really gratifying. It's very satisfying being able to provide online access to the treasure trove that is New Zealand's screen history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work hard to increase this public access by going where the audiences are -- Facebook, Twitter, news websites, radio and television. Our team does a great job of engaging broad audiences, and applying context to the material by tying in current events to historical moments and stories. Working with media organisations continues to increase the reach of our work. NZ On Screen has regular weekly blogs on the news websites Stuff and NZ Herald. We do a monthly television spot on TV One's Good Morning show, and a monthly radio spot on Radio New Zealand. This all helps to spread the word about our great content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This media relations work is a very important part of what we do. We are funded by &lt;a title="NZ On Air" href="http://www.nzonair.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ On Air&lt;/a&gt;, the government broadcast funding agency, and there would be no point in taking public money to make a website showcasing NZ screen works if no one knew the site existed, and no one visited it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZ On Screen doesn't own the rights to any of the TV shows, films or music videos on the site -- we host them with the  permission of the producers, performers and broadcasters who made them. So our titles can't be downloaded and they are not available for Creative Commons usage. But they can be shared via links or embeds (some titles are embeddable, some are not, depending on industry rights agreements). Most titles on the site can be viewed internationally, apart from a few that are geo-locked at the request of the rights holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-minute &lt;a title="ScreenTalk" href="http://screentalk.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;ScreenTalk&lt;/a&gt; video interviews with screen industry personnel that feature on NZ On Screen are fully owned by us, so they are available under a Creative Commons licence, as is all of our written material (biographies and synopses of the titles on the site).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our NZ On Air funding enables us to be a completely non-commercial, 'for the public good’ project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People sometimes refer to NZ On Screen as an online archive, but we don't use this term as we feel it would be rather disrespectful to our colleagues at Archives New Zealand (the National Film Unit collection) and Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision, who do the real archiving and preservation work for the screen industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a minor role in preservation as part of making screen works available online in perpetuity, but Ngā Taonga does the hard yards in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Sarah Davy writes about Ngā Taonga&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Nga Taonga Sound and Vision" href="http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Ngā Taonga Sound &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/a&gt; is the brand name for the New Zealand Archive of Film, Television and Sound Ngā Taonga Whitiāhua Me Ngā Taonga Kōrero.  We are an independent, bicultural, not-for-profit trust that protects and makes available New Zealand’s audio-visual heritage to the widest possible audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold a large and diverse collection of moving image and audio items, along with related documentation (publicity materials, stills, posters, production records, props, costumes and equipment). The collections date from 1895 and span our sound and moving image history – from the earliest days of cinema, audio recording and television, to contemporary film, television, advertisements, music videos, computer games and radio productions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archiving this collection means we must both preserve it for the future and make it available in the present. We believe that access is a result of sustained preservation that ensures that future generations can experience the collection in all its richness and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access-wise, we make our collections available to large and diverse audiences nationwide both online and offline. We have a new website and online catalogue in development, and an extensive screening programme throughout the country, promoting the shared experience of cinema-going. Medianet – a network of digital video access sites in partner art galleries, libraries and museums across New Zealand – allows more than 1,000 moving image titles to be viewed free of charge. We support the production community and the GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) sector to access the collections through our Client Services unit and Audience department. We support research (in all its guises) through libraries in Auckland and Wellington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material in our care is not available under a Creative Commons licence because it remains the property of the depositor and the rights holders. Material is deposited voluntarily – and without cost to the depositor. Ngā Taonga Sound &amp;amp; Vision’s kaupapa of guardianship means the ownership of the original item and its copyright are retained by the appropriate parties, with provision for copying for preservation and access covered through our inclusion within the 1994 Copyright Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Arts</category><category>Irene Gardiner</category><category>Sarah Davy</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/nz-on-screen-and-nga-taonga-sound-vision.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 15:19:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fan Fiction and Creative Commons</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/fan-fiction-creative-commons.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY ELSBETH HYMES HANCOCK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of Fan Fiction has always been around in some way or other. The biggest argument in support of this is the biblical catchphrase 'there is nothing new under the sun', implying that we may as well just re-work what is around us and what we love, whatever the legal ramifications may be. Arguably any re-working of ancient myth -- which has been so prominent in the last few years, with Hollywood films such as &lt;em&gt;Hercules&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Troy&lt;/em&gt;, etc. -- could count as Fan Fiction now, just as it did for the ancient Greek playwrights. It's a matter of definitions and perspective, but the point is that we have always wanted to imagine and daydream about our favourite heroes and heroines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those still confused, Fan Fiction refers to stories written by individuals based on the world and rules of other works, including their favourite characters. Hence a portrayal of Hercules as a geeky teen who ends up with his first wife (in the Disney film) is against 'canon' (where he actually murders her in a rage), but there is no problem with that because myth is always being adapted and we have few reservations about publishing and copyrighting multiple conflicting versions of these myths, fairy tales and older fiction. This has always been the case. But the situation changes when you are building on copyrighted story lines written by authors sensitive about their characters and intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Fan Fiction started with science fiction fans in and around the mid-1970s, particularly to do with &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, and has remained popular in this realm for a long time. Now, a Google search for Twilight -- or whatever your particular obsession might be -- will provide you with endless alternative story lines for your favourite heroes, showing that more and more Fan Fiction is being written and published. The most prominent sites for such activities include &lt;a href="https://www.fanfiction.net" target="_blank"&gt;fanfiction.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.wattpad.com/stories/fanfiction" target="_blank"&gt;Wattpad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Archive of Our Own&lt;/a&gt;. As the names suggest, these stories are written by fans and, just like playwrights of old, they manipulate characters, romances, and story lines, changing them creatively to fit their new imagined stories. Where else could you read a Firefly/Buffy crossover, or your favourite characters finally getting together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond entertainment and community, teachers have even seen how Fan Fiction can motivate students. They have set assignments, encouraging students to write Fan Fiction as a way to learn to write and enhance creativity: &lt;a href="http://writingcommons.org/open-text/new-media/fan-fiction/653-fan-fiction-in-the-composition-classroom" target="_blank"&gt;read more about it here&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, Hugh Howey, the author of the best-selling &lt;em&gt;Silo Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;, wrote that writing Fan Fiction is “&lt;a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/where-words-become-worlds/" target="_blank"&gt;writing with training wheels&lt;/a&gt;” -- and what better way to fall in love with writing than in a safe environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are the legal ramifications? It depends on the individual author. There are a few dangers for authors reading Fan Fiction, as they may be accused of plagiarism or copyright violation due to similarities between their works and works fans have already published. It is common to have an established “I never read any Fan Fiction based on my stories” for just such legal protection. &lt;a href="http://www.themarysue.com/writers-fanfiction/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about that here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as long as there is no monetary gain, there is nothing that can be done to stop Fan Fiction. In fact, this engagement with an author’s world can actually be beneficial to a series or brand, since it helps to keep fans interested, and can even grow their fan base. Entering into a community of others who shared in your fandom can be rewarding, and most Fan Fiction starts with some sort of disclaimer asking either not to be sued or just a simple statement that they are aware that they the characters originated with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations have only just now arrived on the scene. In May of 2013, Amazon launched &lt;a href="https://kindleworlds.amazon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Worlds&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially a selective, monitored and monetised version of the above websites. While contributions are significantly lower, it is a place where Fan Fiction writers can, at long last, can acquire their own copyright and profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of the book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-fifty-shades-to-after-why-publishers-want-fan-fiction-to-go-mainstream/2014/10/24/825d6a94-5a04-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;After&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a piece of fiction based on the group One Direction, has thrown Fan Fiction into the mainstream once more, since &lt;em&gt;50 Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt; was adapted from Twilight Fan Fiction (&lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe&lt;/em&gt;). So what has changed? People are still publishing Fan Fiction online by the thousands, but more and more of it is leaking into traditional publishing, with writers either shaking off their Fan Fiction origins or publishers finding raw talent and having them write something more easily copyrightable. It is becoming easier for authors to move from publishing at a Fan Fiction dedicated site to self-publishing, with some authors being scouted online without having to send manuscripts out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, finally, we can ask what this means for Creative Commons. In order to be copyrightable, a work must be original and expressed in a tangible form. Does Fan Fiction count as original? It is certainly creative -- but &lt;em&gt;50 Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt; had to be adapted out of its original &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; context, and &lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt; had to change the names of the band members. But originality does not necessarily mean completely new, and therefore can be similar to other works so long as there is no copying. Indeed, in the United States, fair use has been considered to apply to works of Fan Fiction in a non-profit (or educational) scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than rigorously guard one's characters and stories, part of the point of writing is to be read -- that is, getting your ideas out there. It is said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and this holds true for Fan Fiction. Hugh Howey encourages Fan Fiction within all his worlds, posting them to his own website, and he has also engaged in Kurt Vonnegut's world via Amazon’s Kindle Worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is always to be more open, to allow for maximum creativity. A Creative Commons licen&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;e on an original work shows that an author is open to Fan Fiction: open to his or her fans adapting, building on and sharing the work. The financial side will always be the more difficult. For now, however, people should be encouraged to explore writing, being as creative as possible by using, adapting and recreating fiction which can then be shared and exchanged easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berlin-based Kiwi illustrator &lt;a title="Judith Carnaby" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Judith Carnaby&lt;/a&gt; shares her experience with Creative Commons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of Creative Commons through reading about &lt;a title="Lawrence Lessig" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt; and his work. The more I read about the development of Creative Commons and the &lt;a title="Copyleft" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" target="_blank"&gt;copyleft &lt;/a&gt;movement, the more interested I became in the CC licences as a less restrictive and more inclusive way to license my work.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_CALENDAR_3.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-425" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_CALENDAR_3-212x300.png" alt="Swimsuit calendar by Judith Carnaby" width="212" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Swimsuit calendar (July) - Lawrence Lessig. Judith Carnaby, CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first illustrations published under a CC licence were for Sam Muirhead's 2013 Year of Open Source &lt;a title="Year of Open Source swimsuit calendar" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/YEAR-OF-OPEN-SOURCE" target="_blank"&gt;swimsuit calendar&lt;/a&gt;, created as a part of his crowdfunding campaign. My illustrations for the calendar (see example above) were of the heroes and heroines of Free Software, Open Hardware and Free Culture, depicting some of the people who have done most to exemplify or further the cause of a more open, collaborative or more freedom-conscious approach to working, thinking and licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was sent as a thank-you to Sam's crowdfunding donors, and due to his focus on Open Source, he also wished to release the images online, with an Attribution-ShareAlike licence, so that people could download, remix and distribute the images. Working with Sam and learning about the people I was illustrating made me think a lot more about the licensing I used for my own work, and since then I have licensed my personal (non-commercial) work under an Attribution ShareAlike licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose that particular licence because I like that the Attribution ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By including the sharealike restriction in the licence, if someone wishes to use my work commercially then they must also open up their own work, which I feel is a positive thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Licensed CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting recent developments for illustration has been the large-scale and high-resolution releases of public domain images from the collections of &lt;a title="Rijksmuseum" href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/explore-the-collection" target="_blank"&gt;institutions in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a title="British Library" href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm" target="_blank"&gt;UK &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a title="New York Public Library" href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Having a huge wealth of unrestricted imagery that can be used and remixed opens up new ways of working, as well as deepening understanding the history and development of illustration as a discipline. More broadly, these online collections of illustrations give us greater and important access to the world's cultural history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my personal work I can choose to license my work as I wish to, but my commercial work is often restricted due to the different needs of my clients. Copyright of commissioned illustrations usually belongs to me, the author of the work, unless there is an agreement for specific use of the illustration. That can depend on what clients are wanting to use the work for, and what length of time. For example, they may wish to use the image online for two months, or two years, after which I can resell or republish it as I wish. Contracts can include agreements that I, or the client, cannot use the illustration for any other purpose other than what was agreed upon. Using copyright agreements often protects an illustrator from being taken advantage of, but most businesses have a limited view on what copyright means and can unnecessarily restrict an illustrator’s right (or sometimes need) to reuse, remix or resell an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to work with clients who are aware of CC licences and use them in their own businesses. For example, I created the cover design for Thomasin Sleigh's novel &lt;a title="Ad Lib" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a title="Ad Lib case study" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/ad-lib-novel-published-cc/"&gt;published under a CC licence&lt;/a&gt;. Another example is the info-video for a bicycle sharing platform, &lt;a title="BikeSurf Berlin" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/filter/moving%20image/BIKESURF-ORG" target="_blank"&gt;BikeSurf Berlin&lt;/a&gt; (see below). To me it makes complete sense to license my work in this way. However, I am disappointed that no one seems to have used or remixed my personal work at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;a title="Thom Sleigh" href="https://twitter.com/TSleigher" target="_blank"&gt;Thomasin Sleigh&lt;/a&gt; has published her debut novel &lt;a title="Ad Lib" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/p/ad-lib-by-thomasin-sleigh.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under Creative Commons &lt;a title="CC licence" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;BY-NC-SA&lt;/a&gt; 4.0 licence, with the publishing collective &lt;a title="Lawrence &amp;amp; Gibson publishers" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence and Gibson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomasin’s work at Digital NZ to open up Aotearoa’s cultural treasures for sharing and reuse has informed her decision to license her own work under CC. “Publishing &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; under a Creative Commons licence was very much an ideological decision. I am an advocate for unlocking cultural resources and, even though my book is published in paper format at the moment, and so is relatively difficult to copy compared to an ebook, I wanted to contribute to the creative commons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomasin has chosen a licence that gives people advance permission to use her work in their own creations, as long as they attribute her and don’t make money from it. “Because I don’t write fiction for a living, I have the freedom to release my work in a way that might be more difficult for professional novelists.” She is also concerned with future-proofing. “The media landscape is only going to change, and keep changing ever more rapidly. I don’t want there to be any confusion in the future about how my work is to be treated.” Fundamentally, Thomasin sees potential reuse as a compliment, not a threat: “if anyone wanted to use or copy from &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt;, I would be genuinely flattered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing a paper book under a CC licence is relatively unusual, and Thomasin was lucky to be published by Lawrence and Gibson, a Wellington-based publishing collective that is open to new and experimental ways of doing things. The cover for &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; was designed by Berlin-based illustrator &lt;a title="Judith Carnaby" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank"&gt;Judith Carnaby&lt;/a&gt;, who licenses her work under CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ADLIB_FRONT_COVER_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-385 size-medium" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ADLIB_FRONT_COVER_2-207x300.jpg" alt="Ad Lib" width="207" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cover of Ad Lib by Thomasin Sleigh, designed by Judith Carnaby; licensed CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printing for &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; was done by hand at &lt;a title="Rebel Press" href="http://www.rebelpress.org.nz/about" target="_blank"&gt;Rebel Press&lt;/a&gt;, an anarchist publishing collective that also offers printing services. Thomasin says that the print irregularities resulting from this handmade process are “love letters from me to the reader”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdLib2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-386 size-medium" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdLib2-300x225.jpg" alt="During the printing process of Ad Lib. Copyright Thomasin Sleigh, licensed CC BY-SA." width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; During the printing process of Ad Lib. Copyright Thomasin Sleigh, licensed CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; were to be published as an ebook in the future, Thomasin says she would definitely license it BY-NC-SA as well. As well as opening up her own work, Thomasin’s licensing decision has exposed publishers at Lawrence and Gibson to the possibilities of book publishing with Creative Commons, so watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomasin is the Community Manager at &lt;a title="Digital NZ" href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Digital NZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a search and data service, which seeks to make Aotearoa's digital treasures easy to find, share, and use. On the international stage, Thomasin is a member of the &lt;a title="OpenGLAM" href="http://openglam.org/working-group/" target="_blank"&gt;OpenGLAM Working Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a global network of people who work to open up cultural data and content in the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives and museums). Thomasin has an MA in art history and a background in writing contemporary art criticism.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Arts</category><category>Elizabeth Heritage</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/ad-lib-novel-published-cc.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2014 12:50:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why authors should oppose DRM in ebooks</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/authors-oppose-drm-ebooks.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 style="color: #222222;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY DARUSHA WEHM&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;As a fiction author, the most important aspect of my business is finding and keeping readers. I want to reduce the barriers between my work and potential readers, so a few years ago, I conducted a survey about book reading and buying habits. One of the questions I asked people was what they would change about getting books. This comment really hit home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;“No DRM. Absolutely none. If eBooks have DRM then I pirate them simply to have them without DRM.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;I agree that, as a reader, DRM is a non-starter for me as well, though there are solutions other than piracy*. But what the heck is DRM, anyway, and how does it affect publishers and authors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter" src="https://static.fsf.org/dbd/label/DRM-free%20label%20120.en.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;DRM stands for Digital Rights Management, which is a way of locking digital goods. DRM is why most Kindle books can’t be read on a Kobo reader. The problem with DRM, of course, is exactly that: if I buy a book from the Sony Reader store, then decide I want to read that book on Stanza on my iPod, too bad for me. Even though it’s my book. As both a reader and an author, this is a barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;Some books from the major ebookstores are sold without DRM and can be converted into other formats. Most, however, are locked unless you remove the DRM (be aware – doing this may be not be considered legal in New Zealand, even if you own the book and are converting it only for your personal use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;I believe that DRM makes digital goods less than fully functional, and I can’t in good conscience sell a defective product. I don’t want DRM in the books I buy, so I don’t sell books with DRM in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;Yes, that means it’s possible for you to give your friend a copy of my book. Yes, that’s theoretically a lost sale for me. But it’s also a possible new reader. So, if you want to give one of my books to someone you think would like it, go ahead. That doesn’t mean uploading the files to P2P sites, but passing on a beloved book to a fellow reader is a long and wonderful tradition among book lovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://darusha.ca/"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/darusha_lg-300x300.jpg" alt="Darusha Wehm" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darusha Wehm CC BY-SA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;* It’s possible to remove the DRM from most legally purchased ebooks. A google search leads to some good information. The open source ebook library software &lt;a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; can help you convert DRM-free books from one format to another with one click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="color: #222222;"&gt;&lt;a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://darusha.ca/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Darusha Wehm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;’s fifth novel, &lt;/i&gt;Children of Arkadia&lt;i&gt;, is forthcoming in Autumn 2015. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/EH-Image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter  wp-image-346" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/EH-Image.jpg" alt="EH Image" width="594" height="171"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am of the generation that has grown up with a vastly changing copyright environment, and my ideas about ownership, sharing, rights, intellectual property, theft and fair use have developed - are developing - accordingly. As I’m the new Comms Lead for Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ, I wanted to use this post to introduce myself and my ideas, particularly - as I’m also a freelance publisher - around books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lifelong consumer of creative media, my attitude to copyright has become a desire to do the right thing (i.e. support artists) tempered by a sort of frustrated pragmatism. For example, I can’t play the DVDs I’ve hired in NZ on my Playstation because I brought it back from the UK with me and it’s region-locked. So I have to rip illegal copies of films I’ve legally hired in order to watch them in my own home. And I’ve more or less given up watching actual television: partly because I want to choose what I watch from around the world, and partly because the energy I’m willing to devote to dancing round the various restrictions only goes so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always try to keep in mind my experience as a consumer when navigating copyright in my professional life as a publisher. On the one hand, publishers and authors need to be able to make a living from books, otherwise there will be fewer (less interesting, less diverse) books and, I firmly believe, human cultural development will suffer. So there needs to be some kind of financial transaction. With books made from paper, this is very easy. We already have an international infrastructure of sales, distribution and bookshops that is essentially one giant paywall between publishers and readers. (Even when you get a book out from the library, the author still gets a cut.) But what about ebooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do about ebooks is a conversation I am constantly having with publishing colleagues around the world. How to best make them, whether to attach digital padlocks (in the form of digital rights/restrictions management, or DRM), how to market and publicise them, and of course, what the hell to do about that giant book-gobbling monolith, Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea that keeps coming up is that piracy is the new publicity. (I really like the rakish “piracy”, sounds so much more dashing and romantic than “copyright infringement”.) Anecdotes abound wherein heavily pirated ebook titles have coincided with (caused?) inflated sales, both print and digital. This is all part of one of the fundamental truths of publishing: word of mouth sells books. Traditionally, publishers have tried to stimulate this by giving free copies to certain influential people (reviewers, journalists). Now, in addition to this, some publishers are trying limited zero-pricing, eg. whereby an ebook is free for a day or a week, then goes back up to its normal price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I keep hearing is that publishers have to get better at communicating to readers the value that publishers add (in terms of editing, book design, sales and marketing infrastructure etc). This is to combat the big lesson that Amazon.com is teaching readers, i.e. that ebooks are only worth a couple of dollars. Well, maybe. It is true that publishing as a profession is enormously valuable, and it is also true that ebooks cost a lot more than 99 cents to produce. But is that the readers’ problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disconnect is partly because, although the words inside may be the same, an ebook is fundamentally a different thing from a paper book. When you buy a paper book, you’re purchasing a stable, singular, physical object with a very clear ownership status. The book was in the shop, you bought it, that particular copy is now yours. Perhaps you will bend a few corners of pages back, or get your copy signed by the author, thus rendering your copy physically distinct from others. Your book-as-tangible-object will be unaffected by which electronic devices you own, which media platforms you patronise, how the Amazon vs Hachette battle plays out, and how well you back up your data. No malware in the world can touch it. Your paper book feels steady, feels valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ebook feels completely different. For a start - and this is especially true for books marked with DRM - purchasing an ebook feels much more like purchasing a licence to read a particular work, rather than buying an instance of the work itself. It’s also a lot more fiddly: you have to make sure that you get the right kind of file for the right kind of device. Often you find yourself unable to transfer your ebook from one of your devices to another, even though they all belong to you. And even if the ebook file works now, it’s vulnerable to future technological developments rendering it unreadable, possibly quite soon. Ebooks feel almost like a rental - temporary, with less commitment. Less valuable. No wonder we think they ought be cheap, even free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And DRM - part of publishers’ doomed attempt to assert a paper-based copyright model in the face of the digital age - turns out to just be a giant pain. All it does is create irritating hitches, like my Playstation being unable to play local DVDs. DRM ebooks are much more difficult to share, which directly affects the power of word-of-mouth marketing. How will your friends know how wonderful your new favourite novel is if you can’t lend it to them? We have the big lesson of the music industry staring us in the face: the easier you can make electronic creations to purchase, the more consumers will be inclined to buy rather than steal them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us? How can we strike a balance between ensuring that books reach the widest possible audience while maintaining an economically viable creative industry that supports authors and publishers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think that the traditional copyright model is best for paper books: that still feels fair (except I think copyright should die when the creator does). But I believe that paper and digital are sufficiently different that ebooks - even electronic versions of the same title - require a different approach. They need to be sold differently, marketed differently, stored and distributed differently. Their copyright needs to be managed much more openly, with a focus on attracting readers through ease of sharing, rather than the punitive, adversarial approach of DRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can stop readers pirating ebooks. That option is off the table. Instead, it is publishers’ and booksellers’ responsibility to make high-quality, legitimately purchased, easy-to-share ebooks easier and more pleasant to access than pirated copies. I don’t know yet exactly how we’re going to do this, so please do chip in with your own ideas. But I have faith that somehow the publishing industry can make it happen. If you book them, they will come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an aspiring photojournalist, or just happen to be in the right place at the right time, we’d love for you to take political photos and &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard" target="_blank"&gt;upload them&lt;/a&gt; to Wikimedia commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kinds of photos are we after? Pretty much any documentary photos: portraits of politicians (both as people and doing distinctively political things); hustings; polling stations; election-night parties; voter enrollment campaigns; election campaigns; etc. While even a poor quality image is better than no image of a subject, what we’re really after is well-composed, well-executed images of at least two megapixels. The better the quality of the image, the more options are available to users of the image going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describing and labelling your images is important—there are more than twenty million images on &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt; and without good descriptions and labels they’ll be unfindable. You should aim to describe who, what, when and where. Who are the people (if any) in the image? What are they doing? When are they do it? Where are they doing it? Descriptions of composition (‘landscape,’ ‘three-quarters length portrait,’ etc) can also be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally we’re after photos to illustrate the people, places, events and abstract concepts which we have Wikipedia articles on. Fun projects: include stitched panoramas from local look-out spots; photos of public art installed locally; local marae, whakairo and tukutuku; portraits of local artists or officeholders; local historical sites (Māori pā, buildings listed by the Historic Places Trust, gravestones of notable people, etc); New Zealand native plants and animals; — the list is endless. New Zealand subject matter isn’t going to be documented by anyone else, so it’s largely up to us to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s possible to upload images that other people have taken, due to the complications of getting copyright clearance, it’s better if the person who took the photos uploads the images. It’s typically easier to re-take photos than jump through the hoops of copyright clearance, unless you are dealing with thousands of photos or those of particular historical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the English and Māori language Wikipedias have access to the same pool on images on Wikimedia commons, but the English language Wikipedia, as the larger of the two, uses many more images. Commons images can also also be used in Wikibooks, Wikiversity and other members of the WikiMedia family or reused in your own projects under appropriate licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank"&gt;publicly-funded map data they hold&lt;/a&gt; under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded &lt;a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank"&gt;TimeBanking platform&lt;/a&gt; and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank"&gt;a great talk&lt;/a&gt; about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;the CC-NZ email list&lt;/a&gt;, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like &lt;a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank"&gt;the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud&lt;/a&gt;, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo Māori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In '&lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing&lt;/a&gt;', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.&lt;/p&gt;
