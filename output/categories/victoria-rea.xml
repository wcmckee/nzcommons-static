&lt;p&gt;While there has been no New Zealand court decision regarding the use or validity of Creative Commons Licenses, there have been decisions we can turn to in comparable overseas jurisdictions. This will give us some foundation for deciding how the New Zealand courts might treat a case involving CC. Since Creative Commons licensing is relatively new, there are only a few cases that illustrate how the courts might treat CC licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curry v Audax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One notable case comes from the Netherlands: &lt;a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Curry_v._Audax" target="_blank"&gt;Curry v Audax&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, a former MTV star took a case against a Dutch gossip magazine. Adam Curry, former MTV star sued “Weekend” for a copyright infringement after the magazine published photos of his daughter without his permission. The photos had been posted on the Flickr photo-sharing site covered by a creative Commons – Attribution – Non Commercial Share Alike licence. In this case, it was held that the terms of the Creative Commons licence were binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important issue that came up concerned the due diligence that the company should have performed to find the type of license that had been placed on the photos. The defendant magazine claimed that the photos had been publicly shared; there was, therefore, no need to seek authority to publish. However, the courts held that the company did in fact have to ask for authority to publish, noting that it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that they are meeting the requirements of the CC license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GateHouse Media, Inc. v. That’s Great News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second case is from the Northern District of Illinois in the United States: GateHouse Media, Inc. v. That’s Great News. This case includes a claim that the defendant violated the terms of a Creative Commons licence covering the plaintiffs copyrighted works. Gate House Media publish a number of local newspapers for the region. The Register Start, a local newspaper, provides its content online to subscribers under a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Non Derivative License. The defendant party used this information for the creation of plaques for people mentioned in the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case was settled on August 17, 2010. The settlement was not made public,  which is unfortunate, as there are are several interesting aspects to this case. The first is the use of Creative Commons licenses for the purpose of blocking content for the commercial use and whether placing these kinds of strict licenses is actually in the interest of commercial competition. The second is the extent to which the No Derivatives licence applies and whether in this instance the defendant will have been said to alter the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deutschlandradio v Photographer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third case to look at is &lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140326/11405526695/german-court-says-creative-commons-non-commercial-licenses-must-be-purely-personal-use.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;a case from Germany&lt;/a&gt; that recently discussed the use of the Non Commercial Creative Commons licence and how far it extended in use. The case revolved around a photo from Flickr released on a Non Commercial license, which was used by Deutschlandradio -- a public broadcaster and non commercial organisation. The website also included the name of the artist, licence and link to its terms. Despite this, the artist sued. The public broadcaster pointed out there was no charge for their website, no advertising, no sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless the judge treated the use by  Deutschlandradio as commercial. In doing so, the judge relied on German Common law which defines non commercial as purely for personal use. This case reveals how different common law positions from different jurisdictions may effect how Creative Commons licenses are treated in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chang v Virgin Mobile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the closest jurisdictional cases is from Australia: &lt;a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Chang_v._Virgin_Mobile" target="_blank"&gt;Chang v Virgin Mobile&lt;/a&gt;. This case involves a Creative Commons licensed image in Flickr being used in an Australian phone advertisement. Chang brought a suit against Virgin under a number of causes of action including invasion of privacy, copyright infringement and breach of contract. The takeaway from the case was that Creative Commons licenses only address the creator’s copyright. The licenses do not affirmatively affect publicity or privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SGAE v Fernandez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish case &lt;a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/SGAE_v._Fernandez" target="_blank"&gt;SGAE v Fernandez&lt;/a&gt; looks at a Creative Commons licensing issue for music at a bar. SGAE, a collecting society, sued a disco bar owner alleging that he had failed to pay SGAE the license fee required for public performances of music. The Court rejected the claims because the bar owner successfully showed that the music playing in his bar was not managed by the collecting society but rather was licensed under a Creative Commons license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing to take away from this case though is that in nearly all previous cases the Spanish courts had ruled in favour of SGAE, under the assumption that the collecting society managed most of the music. This case set a new precedent in Spain and showed that courts recognise different kinds of licensing for music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gerlach v DVU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final case is from Berlin: &lt;a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Gerlach_vs._DVU" target="_blank"&gt;Gerlach v DVU&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, the validity of the Creative Commons license was upheld. The facts are quite straightforward: A woman called Nina Gerlach took a photograph of German Politician Thilo Sarrazin and uploaded it to Wikipedia under a Creative Commons licence. The defendant, a German Political party website, posted the picture without attribution or a link to the original as specified in the terms of the licence. Gerlach sued for breach of licence. The judge considered that the defendant was in breach of the licence and therefore breaching copyright. The judge issued an injunction, ordering the website to remove the picture. This is the best case law example to date showing how Creative Commons Licenses are being upheld in jurisdictions, as it shows judges willing to step in where there has been an obvious breach of the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at why there haven’t been many cases involving Creative Commons licenses there are two main reasons that stand out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the licences are new, which  means that there is always going to be a time-lapse before problems actually arise that are serious enough to be resolved in court; and,&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Creative Commons licenses are simple to understand, which may mean that there has actually been very few major breaches, which may in turn lead to very few cases being brought that are relevant to Creative Commons.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While favourable court cases help to promote CC adoption by commercial enterprises and the public sector,  it is important to remind everyone that there is no reason to doubt their validity in the first place. Nevertheless, as these examples show, it is likely that if a case were to arise in New Zealand that the court would uphold the licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive Open Online Courses -- otherwise known as MOOCs. What are they? Why were they created? And how effective are they in the face of all the criticisms against them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MOOC is essentially an open course, free of charge, open to anyone with an Internet connection. MOOCs are the latest advancement in online education and distance education, and have been adopted by some of the top universities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOOCs are set apart from other models of distance and online education by the scale that they manage to reach. Some courses have hundreds of thousands of enrolments. This illustrates the true potential of MOOCs for not only domestic students, but also students in the global south, where higher education may be inaccessible to the majority of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MOOC platforms&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of main platforms that supply Massive Open Online Courses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a company created by Harvard and MIT that hosts nine main courses mirroring the campus courses taught by the universities. It is currently focusing on hard sciences and mathematics. Students do not receive credit from the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coursera&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;is the largest MOOC platform, with over 200 courses. Courses cover a large range of topics, from the hard sciences and math to classics, history and other humanities subjects. The courses are made up from input for academics and professors from thirty universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Udacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a middle range provider, with roughly 19 courses. One thing that sets this provider apart from the rest is that you are allowed to spend as long you want completing the courses. They also have a distinct no textbook policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have the &lt;a href="http://oeru.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OERu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, coordinated by the OER Foundation. They are an independent not for profit network that offers free online courses for students worldwide. They also partner with several recognised institutions to create an affordable way for learners to gain academic credit. What is special about this platform is that it is based in Dunedin, New Zealand and is run off truly open principles. One of the founding principles of the organisation is to provide for those who are excluded from the formal education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Kinds of MOOCs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the different platforms that supply MOOCs there are also broadly three different kinds of MOOCs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xMOOCs&lt;/strong&gt; are usually offered in a very similar format to the traditional university model. Traditional universities especially in America, especially Ivy League universities are the driving force behind this model. Learning is primarily focused on rote learning, where there are a variety on lectures on a range of topics that can range from 3-30 minutes. There are tests and assignments that are computer graded; very little direct instructor feedback or discussion is provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CMOOCs&lt;/strong&gt; are based on a constructivist approach that views knowledge as a networked state and learning as the process of generating those networks. There is a large range of topics and themes are very broad to allow for more learner engagement in areas that they want to learn more about. Content is delivered through lecture-based videos but there is a lot more emphasis on discussion forums, conversations with other participants and feedback from experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QuasiMOOCs&lt;/strong&gt; only very broadly fit in the definition of MOOCs. These are web-based tutorials that house a large range of Open Education Resources. An example of such an organisation is the Khan Academy. These are not technically traditional courses and are more a range of loosely related educational resources that are collected together under one theme or skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Why MOOCs?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why were MOOCs created? And what criticisms exist around their use? In essence, MOOCs are a response to the opportunities and challenges of changing technology. Education is a fundamental right enshrined in many pieces of both domestic and international legislation and multiple organisations are constantly working on being able to increase access to education and the quality of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they were first launched, MOOCs appeared to many as a near infallible tool that could help the spread of quality education to both domestic students unable to afford higher education and excluded students in the developing world. However, MOOCs have not been without their problems or criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Copyright&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the largest problems with MOOCs is the grey area surrounding copyrights. The question of who owns what content becomes very complicated, especially as there are so many different parties involved. Early examples of MOOCs used open Creative Commons licences, such as BY-NC-SA, which allows students to share, redistribute and remix the course material, as they liked so long as they licensed the new material they created in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is truly scary about the copyrighting issues with MOOCs is the claims that some third party platforms have over copyright of individual intellectual property. The major three platforms claim an exclusive license to use, distribute and reproduce and modify intellectual property, including the right to use all student material for commercial purposes. This effectively claims ownership over the intellectual property from all people who are party to the courses. Interestingly, it is also these platforms that have the tightest restrictions on copyright regarding the material that they create and distribute to their members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Drop Out Rates&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the largest problems with MOOCs is the large drop out or non-completion rate. If MOOCs were used for the purpose of specifically gaining a qualification or recognition of completion of a topic, then it would make sense to judge their success on the basis of drop out rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, research shows that there is a large range of reasons that people enroll in MOOCs – some of which is purely interest based, which means that the completion of that course is not necessarily what they are aiming towards. Dropouts rates will obviously become more or an issue where institutions consider providing course credit to a MOOC participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Sustainability&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOOCs are free – so how will they be sustainable? Third party platforms that host these courses need to get their funding from somewhere; without additional funding, it will become harder for them to host the same kind of free courses that they currently do. The idea of introducing fees has been floated. However, this would remove one of the most fundamental aspects of MOOCs: that they are free and therefore accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Should we endorse MOOCs?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this discussion brings us back to the question that in the pursuit of open education are the innovations such as MOOCs really open and something we should endorse? In their title, MOOCs claim to be open; at present, though, it is clear that most MOOCS are not as open as they might initially appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear whether MOOCs are just the educational buzzword of the moment or whether they will become a sustainable and effective method of delivering education. But it is certain that there are still a number of issues and criticisms for them to overcome before they are reflective of the principles of truly open education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to education is a fundamental human right, as enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Throughout the world there is a disparity to access of not only education but also high quality educational resources. Open Education is a viable solution to widening access to quality education for all students worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rsz_1rsz_ma_i119853.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-329" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rsz_1rsz_ma_i119853.jpg" alt=" A student, by Petrus van der Velden.

&lt;h5&gt;What is Open Education?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Education is based on the simple idea that knowledge is powerful and a public good, and that it is in the best interests of society to increase access to education and educational resources in order to produce a well informed and educated citizenry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, more and more educators and educational institutions have started to open their resources under open licences, so that these resources can be freely (and legally) accessed, shared and adapted. Open Education provides everyone access to learning materials, most of all those non-traditional groups of students that aren’t engaged in the formal education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Why is it Important in Tertiary Education?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the changes in technology over the last decade,most universities and other tertiary education institutions have been relatively slow to recognise the potential of open educational resources. Higher educational institutions have been using the internet and other digital technologies for several years. Yet, until recently, most learning materials were locked up behind passwords in closed systems that were unreachable for outsiders. Open Education aims to break down such barriers and encourage and enable the free sharing of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities are constantly trying to improve their teaching practices by making their processes more engaging and motivating and Open Education Resources are a good method to address some of the problems that tertiary students currently face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five broader arguments on why higher education institutions should develop open education resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The sharing of knowledge is a good thing, in line with human rights and generally speaking beneficial for society, especially those with little access to formal higher education;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Resources developed by publicly funded institutions should be able to be freely shared and reused by the public;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Sharing and reusing content reduces the costs of development i, thereby increasing efficiency;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Open education resources presents a more positive and accessible view of education and can attract new students;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Open practices can increase the quality and innovation of resources, as less time has to be spent on information that has already been collated by someone else.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;The Cost of Education&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of education, and especially higher education, is ever increasing. When enrolling in university, you not only already face the $600- $800 dollars to enroll in one paper for one semester; you also face the sometimes exorbitant prices for some textbooks and resources. Students often have to turn to outdated editions of textbooks -- or even opt not to buy them due to their unaffordability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you pay $100 for the latest edition of an 'essential' textbook (which the lecturer is the author of), and also use it twice in a semester, it is easy to see why many are calling for open educational resources. Also, due to the increasing spread by which knowledge and information is produced and disseminated throughout the globe, textbooks can become less relevant days after they are printed when new information comes to light. There is a strong need for up to date and accurate information especially in tertiary education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Education Resources are a way to mitigate this problem. The price of educational content doesn’t need to be as expensive as it currently is. Through sharing this content online, we can add to the pool of information which students all around the world can have access to with little to no financial hindrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education is an integral part of society and participation in higher education is increasingly in demand throughout the world. Despite the large number of people engaged in education there are still barriers to education such as the cost of resources. The idea of Open Educational Resources has the ability to mitigate some of the barriers facing people trying to enter the tertiary education sector.&lt;/p&gt;
