&lt;p&gt;Academic research works by explicitly free sharing of information, and any friction introduced into the process decreases its efficiency, in turn reducing the return on investment we make into any kind of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a sophisticated position on the harmonisation on the various reuse provisions “Fair Dealing” and “Fair Use” within the TPPA actors. As librarians we are expected to have a clear understanding on practical issues around this, and the current situation means we are unable to offer advice and guidance for the medium term. It is not just uncomfortable for us personally; it could lead to a position of liability for our organisations as we make research outputs available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As librarians we are the sharp end of the balance between providing adequate protection for copyright holders to exploit their creations, and access to research to our community, and the wider academic world for material that they have paid for through taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am concerned that there will be more corporate interference in access to publicly paid-for research, just as business models are starting to change to an Open Access model where organisations sponsor and patronise profit and not-for-profit businesses to provide publishing platforms for research analysis and data. Corporate organisations have a responsibility to provide a maximum return for their shareholders, but not at the cost of reducing access to tax-payer funded research. Library budgets are at such low levels that they cannot afford to purchase the research outputs of record their own organisation has funded in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one element of the friction against efficient research I was talking about above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is not one of established objective regulation, but the chilling effect of extended copyright provisions has on sharing research in the minds of researchers themselves. Copyright is not well understood by researchers, even with the best efforts of librarians and records offices. It is a tangential field to research proper, part of the game of scholarly publishing. As (mostly media) businesses protect their output more and more closely, to the point of employing third party bounty hunters to find infringements to prosecute, researchers become more concerned about protecting their property, to the point of being overly sensitive. This adds yet more friction to research efficiency for no reason other than fear of breaking some misunderstood rule. “Because copyright” has become the standard response for a number of perverse behaviours, including supervisors recommending to students to hide their postgraduate research for a number of years, not to make work available on institutional repositories even though it is legitimate to do so, and stifle sharing and collaboration between institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring strong provisions for Fair Dealing are fundamental to be able to criticise, review and expand on previous work. Any uncertainty on the ability to do so is not just a blow to the high minded ideals of academic freedom, but a sheet anchor on research and innovation in a very practical sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good response to these concerns is a policy change for all NZ funded research to be mandated to be published immediately as Open Access. This would create a level, clear and unambiguous regulatory platform which would remove fear, uncertainty and doubt over access to publicly funded research. In some cases extra funding for research institutions would be required to sponsor commercial platforms, but the reduction in the price of subscriptions through libraries would offset that to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model has been developed and is operating in the UK, and for all state funded research over a certain amount in the US. NZ will be at a considerable disadvantage if it does not follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin Bond, a semi-retired Classics lecturer from Canterbury, has spent his life translating and directing ancient Greek theatre. Over the years he has amassed a series of his own translations of all the Greek plays we know of, in verse, created specifically to be staged, as well as studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could have published these as a volume, a small run from an academic press that would have been the culmination of a career (not that his career is over by a long stretch, you’d have to physically restrain him from teaching, directing and studying). This could have sat in academic libraries, and influenced classics students for years to come, if they bought it. Libraries already have copies of all of these already -- different translations, translated for different purposes, and even editions in the original Greek. In these lean times for library acquisitions sales might have been pretty sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, over lunch, I convinced Robin to send me the manuscripts, I had a book designer look over them and make them beautiful, and we have started to pop them up on our Institutional Repository. The first play we have put up is &lt;a title="Antigone" href="http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9681" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antigone&lt;/em&gt;, by Sophocles&lt;/a&gt;. We will have them all up by &lt;a title="OA Week" href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Access Week&lt;/a&gt; (October) this year. They are all published with a &lt;a title="CC BY" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/a&gt; (CC BY).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that something will happen. Sitting on the repository is useful, but they are just raw material. Content. I’m hoping that someone will make a lovely web page for them, or include them in a course, realising that they are free for anyone to use. I really hope that someone will stage one of these, using these as the text to work from, because that’s what they were originally for. What I most want though, is someone uses them for something that we haven’t even thought of. That a school picks one up, and turns it into a musical. Or animates one. Or projects it into space on a laser beam for aliens. Actually, I might do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Arduino Morse" href="https://github.com/markfickett/arduinomorse" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s an arduino library&lt;/a&gt; to create the Morse code -- so now all I need is the laser...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the manager of an Institutional Repository, one of my regular tasks is to tell enquirers why they can’t download a PDF that they have found with Google from our collection. The work is there, but we have had to embargo it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming more common for us to embargo work. There are a multitude of reasons why we do so that, when put together, give a view into the process of scholarly publishing from economic, personal and professional perspectives. But are academic publishing embargoes just delaying the inevitable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold two main types of work. The first type is theses, dissertations and research reports: things that have been created for a qualification. I’m dead impressed with anyone who has finished a thesis -- it’s a masterpiece in the old sense -- the work you need to have done to call yourself a master in your trade, signalling the end of your apprenticeship. Even the 4th-year student work that departments submit is good stuff, on a huge range of topics from fire engineering (&lt;a title="couch burning" href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/8545" target="_blank"&gt;this guy got a degree by burning couches&lt;/a&gt;) to history. The other sort of work we collect is research outputs by staff and students: mostly manuscript, final versions of journal articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone want to delay public access to this work? With anything as complex as research there are always going to be a few individual circumstances that are not easily put into categories, but the main ones are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Shyness&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thesis can be the first time someone writes for a public audience. All through an academic career you write, it gets read by one or two people, and that’s it. Filed, or thrown away. For some great work, this is a terrible shame, which is why we accept all sorts of student work, as long as the quality is assured. Nonetheless, people are nervous about their work, and simple self-effacement can lead students to embargo their work for as long as possible. Our response is that if your work passed, and you were credited with the qualification, then you should be proud of your work, not embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Concerns about plagiarism&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theses are great resources for researchers -- I’ve written about this before -- just the literature review or the bibliography is a great primer in a field. The ideas in the thesis can’t be protected though, and authors are worried that they might get stolen. The answer to this is simple: if you don’t put up a version of record, you can’t establish your primacy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Publishers won’t publish me if the same data is in my thesis&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far the most common reason for embargoes on theses. I wish I had some more-than-anecdotal evidence that this was true. Some research has been done in the social sciences, and has shown that a publishable book is a very different thing to a thesis (Ramirez et al, 2012). Even then, having an Open Access electronic version of a scholarly monograph has also been shown to increase the sales of print copies of exactly the same thing! I’m not aware of similar research done in STEM, but the speed of scientific publishing is such that papers are now normally lined up before the thesis has even been submitted for marking. If readers have evidence of this, I’d really like to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;I have a contractual obligation to embargo this work&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For journal articles, having an embargo on the version in the repository is often demanded by publishers. Repositories form a very potent threat to the traditional toll-based publishers -- why would you pay millions of dollars in subscriptions to journals if the same work was available for free? Embargoes are one of the contractual tools publishers use to fight the creeping advance of Open Access, along with many other stipulations designed to make an repository version of an article as unappealing as possible. When the US government demanded that publicly funded federal research be openly accessible, the stoush about embargo lengths (publishers demanded 2 years, and were fought down to 12 months) was protracted and bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What authors don’t realise is that they have all the power. Once the paper has been accepted, all contractual agreements are up for grabs -- obviously the journal wants the paper, it will sell more subscriptions. So why would an author want to make a fuss and reduce the embargo? Because they will get more citations for their work, which is how you win at the current academic game. A lot of recent work now confirms a considerable advantage for papers that are published Open Access, and early. I won’t cite specific papers, but point you to a &lt;a title="SPARC Europe" href="http://sparceurope.org/oaca/" target="_blank"&gt;website dedicated to this&lt;/a&gt;, as new work is occurring constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there are few good reasons to embargo your research (though there will always be exceptions). Publishing early, and with a license that allows your work to find its fullest audience, is the best use of the resource that has gone into your research, and will pay you the best reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From little things, big things grow: a personal reflection on &lt;a title="Mandatory research deposit policy announcement" href="http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/blogs/counterculture.php?itemid=18365" target="_blank"&gt;mandatory deposit of research&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Canterbury, by &lt;a title="Anton Angelo" href="http://mojo.org/portfolio/" target="_blank"&gt;Anton Angelo&lt;/a&gt;, Repository Manager at the University of Canterbury Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I had an email discussion with the developer for our university research information system. My request is to make a file upload field required rather than optional. It, in the scheme of things, is a tiny change -- a couple of lines of code in an application that is going to be used by a few hundred people at a medium scale university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case though, the change that this represents is huge. It is the bleeding edge of a change in the way that we understand intellectual property, and realigns the academy with its original intention of being a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;univers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;ity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canterbury, like &lt;a title="IRs around the world" href="http://roarmap.eprints.org/" target="_blank"&gt;well over 200 other universities&lt;/a&gt; is adopting an ‘institutional mandate’ for depositing research into its Institutional Repository (IR; see &lt;a title="Institutional Repositories 101" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/institutional-repositories-101/" target="_blank"&gt;Amanda Curnow’s clear description&lt;/a&gt; of what an IR is). We have purposefully kept the word ‘mandate’, as the implication of imposing something on scholars provoked the discussion we wanted -- positive engagement with what we were proposing. In reality the policy suggests that, in the absence of a good reason, every time a scholar publishes something it should be made freely available, and we provide a mechanism to do that with our IR. If a scholar wishes to opt out, they should feel free, but we’re curious to know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small technical change we are making is that we’re requiring a copy of a research output submitted for the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) process to be made available and openly accessible for the entire world, by uploading it to our IR. Currently, University of Canterbury scholars can volunteer to upload articles, and about 8% of our research output is put on the web and openly accessible. By making the file upload field required, we hope to see a tenfold increase in deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are historical precedents. The library of Alexandria had a mandate to take all the books arriving in the port, copy them, keep the originals, and return the copies. This way -- along with an excellent and aggressive collections budget -- the biggest library in the world was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaction to the suggestion of the policy in the community was interesting. The vast majority of faculty research committee meetings and private conversations ended with, “why are we not doing this already?”. It underscored the importance most researchers seem to place on having the widest possible audience for their work. There were exceptions to that, usually based on the culture of a particular academic discipline. For example: high-energy physicists (and others) already use a repository, &lt;a title="Arxiv" href="http://arxiv.org/" target="_blank"&gt;ArXive&lt;/a&gt;. Why should they bother with another one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit that uploading things to the IR is a faff for a lot of reasons. For example, because of the copyright most publishers take when they agree to print an article, scholars have to upload a version that is not the final published one. Academics are not great administrators, and can lose their manuscripts. As well as that it is an extra button to push, a file to hunt down on their hard drive, and then finally, troubling thoughts of “am I &lt;em&gt;allowed &lt;/em&gt;to do this?” can overwhelm all but the most robustly legally minded. That last one -- what are you allowed to do with your own work? -- is a doozy. A scholar in the humanities admitted to me that on being offered the loan of a book his first thought was, “is he allowed to loan me that”? So entrenched are our anxieties on copyright that even the thing that lets libraries exist can be questioned by people who should know much, much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make no apologies for the faff, for it is not faff of our making. We pay researchers to do research, and their research needs to be available for that most old-fashioned of reasons: the common good. You can quantify the good all you like in terms of innovation and product development and state corporate bottom line maximisation, but for me the qualitative argument comes first, and looms largest. It’s the right thing to do. So why is it hard? Wherefore the faff? Traditional academic publishers are on a bit of a losing wicket on this one. Made gigantic on the economic imperatives of globalisation and the efficiencies of the library ‘big deal’, they now have profits they are legally bound to protect for their shareholders. Faff is their stock-in-trade as a way of slowing down the opposition -- the IR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few ways academic publishers try to slow down deposit into IRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Most standard publisher-author agreements allow only an obscure version of the work to be added to the IR.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;They confuse the Open Access (OA) landscape by offering their own version of openly accessible articles, and play divide and conquer with their customers by making the academic pay a charge (often in the thousands of dollars) to publish under an open licence.

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Additionally, sometimes they offer their own ‘open’ licences, resulting in even greater uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;They employ third parties to scour IRs to find material that could be non-compliant, and send threatening letters. Libraries, being excellent corporate citizens, respond to these by removing material.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Knowing that old data is less sexy data, they require embargoes on the release of IR versions of articles, knowing that makes the IRs less useful.
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;As well as this, at least one publisher requires embargoes on IR content &lt;em&gt;only if the institution requires its scholars to submit their research outputs to its IR&lt;/em&gt;, an open recognition that IRs threaten publishers’ business model.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It may seem with all those tactics that there is a great conflict going on, but there really isn’t. It is not a war. The arbitrary exclusions and hoops above are the artefacts of a rapidly changing (and potentially failing) business model. New publishers, like PeerJ, Hindawi, and PLoS among many, many others, are simply starting with the assumption that the material will be OA, and they are a low or non-profit business, and can undercut the old guard entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Canterbury, we have made a tiny technical change. Instead of asking scholars to volunteer their work to be made openly accessible, we ask why they would not. That little thing signals a mighty change for the availability of new knowledge to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Anton Angelo</category><category>Research</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/mandatory-research-deposit-university-canterbury.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 09:54:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>When is Open Access not Open Access?</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/open-access-open-access.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY ANTON ANGELO&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it's ‘Openly Accessible’, that’s when. The goal of Open Access is to make material legitimately freely available to the end user. Note the careful caveats: “freely”, implying no cost as well as easily findable; and “legitimately”, meaning legally unencumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of stuff out there on the net is Openly Accessible: you can find it, download it, read it or play it, but not much else. A good example of this is a lot of material on University Institutional Repositories. You may not think you know what they are, but you use them all the time if you do any research. When you search Google Scholar and there is a link to a PDF or txt document that isn’t to the original journal, that’s probably in some kind of repository. If the link is held at a university, it will probably be an institutional repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/8759939806_3413a663c2_z1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-301 size-full" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/8759939806_3413a663c2_z1.jpg" alt="8759939806_3413a663c2_z" width="424" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Reference: Cropped "&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/archivesnz/8759939806" target="_blank"&gt;Lower Level Three Stacks"&lt;/a&gt; by Archives New Zealand. Copyright: &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank"&gt;CC-BY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Repositories (IRs) hold a lot of stuff, but the best stuff, the stuff no-one else has, are postgraduate theses. &lt;a href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;At Canterbury's IR &lt;/a&gt;we have pretty much all the doctoral theses online, and we are working through Masters and other degree Research Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is gold in there. The oldest is a 1914 work on &lt;a href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/3979" target="_blank"&gt;the outrageous land prices in Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;plus ça change&lt;/em&gt;). I know that some have been downloaded many thousands of times, and I have had emails of appreciation for making work available from as far away as a Nepalese ostrich farmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 5,500 theses, and I put about a dozen up every week - both new theses and newly scanned older ones. As well as being a great research topic in themselves, the data in these works is invaluable. They contain geological maps, bibliographies, raw data sets -- every conceivable kind of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can you do with them once you have read them? Almost nothing. You can quote bits of them, as long as you attribute the author. Can you print out one of the maps and put it on your wall? No. Can you re-use the data tables? Maybe, but you would best to ask the author of the thesis, if you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that all the theses have been uploaded with an “All Rights Reserved” licence, which, at the time the repository was founded, was not a bad choice. I’m working to get at least a choice of licences available for new theses, and I have a lot of support from my organisation to do so. But the people who really need to use the licences are the owners of the work -- the students writing their theses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as easy as it sounds - in a lot, if not a majority of cases, this is the first work a student has made publicly available. Previously, when students wrote an assignment, it went to an assessor, and that was it. Now, they are being asked to put their name to something that is going to be available all over the world, and they are quite justifiably shy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer the option to hold back making the thesis public (an ‘embargo’) for a variety of legitimate reasons. Recently the rates of embargoes has shot up. (Is that coincidental with the issues of privacy being made more accessible through platforms like Facebook? Maybe. There is probably a thesis topic in that, just in itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theses are Openly Accessible, but not, in our case, or the case of the majority of universities around the world, “Open Access”. We can access the work, but we can’t do anything with it, other than quote it. It may seem like splitting legal hairs, but it will become an important distinction if we decide to start mining this fantastic resource for information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often this work is the best stuff thesis writers will ever do, and it deserves respect. The best way we can respect it is to make it as available for reuse as possible, and get all the value we can out it.&lt;/p&gt;
